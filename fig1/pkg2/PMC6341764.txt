Abstract

Background

   The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by the
   acute onset of hypoxemia and bilateral lung infiltrates in response to
   an inciting event, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.
   Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
   (HSCT) are at increased risk for ARDS. We hypothesized that HSCT
   patients with ARDS would have a unique transcriptomic profile
   identifiable in peripheral blood compared to those that did not undergo
   HSCT.

Methods

   We isolated RNA from banked peripheral blood samples from a
   biorepository of critically ill ICU patients. RNA-Seq was performed on
   11 patients with ARDS (5 that had undergone HSCT and 6 that had not)
   and 12 patients with sepsis without ARDS (5 that that had undergone
   HCST and 7 that had not).

Results

   We identified 687 differentially expressed genes between ARDS and
   ARDS-HSCT (adjusted p-value < 0.01), including IFI44L, OAS3, LY6E, and
   SPATS2L that had increased expression in ARDS vs. ARDS-HSCT; these
   genes were not differentially expressed in sepsis vs sepsis-HSCT. Gene
   ontology enrichment analysis revealed that many differentially
   expressed genes were related to response to type I interferon.

Conclusions

   Our findings reveal significant differences in whole blood
   transcriptomic profiles of patients with non-HSCT ARDS compared to
   ARDS-HSCT patients and point toward different immune responses
   underlying ARDS and ARDS-HSCT that contribute to lung injury.

Background

   ARDS is a syndrome with high morbidity and mortality characterized by
   the acute onset of bilateral lung infiltrates and hypoxemia that
   frequently results in acute respiratory failure [[62]1]. A recent study
   demonstrated that the worldwide burden of ARDS is greater than
   previously appreciated and accounts for up to 10% of intensive care
   unit (ICU) admissions [[63]2]. Despite decades of research into the
   pathophysiology underlying ARDS, supportive care with mechanical
   ventilation remains the mainstay of therapy, and there are no effective
   targeted pharmacologic treatments for these patients. One barrier to
   developing effective therapies is that ARDS is a heterogeneous syndrome
   that encompasses a wide variety of patients with lung injury from many
   different causes. We and other groups have postulated that the
   pathophysiology of lung injury in ARDS subgroups may differ
   substantially which, in turn, may lead to variable responses in ARDS
   clinical trials [[64]3–[65]6]. Recently, several studies have used
   clinical data and previously identified biomarkers to define several
   ARDS subphenotypes with distinct clinical outcomes, inflammatory
   profiles, and response to ARDS therapies [[66]3, [67]7, [68]8]
   underscoring the need for a better understanding of these different
   populations.

   One important subgroup of patients at increased risk for ARDS that
   experience particularly high mortality are those with hematologic
   malignancies undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. While
   allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a
   life-saving treatment for patients with hematologic malignancies
   [[69]9], a variety of pulmonary complications, both infectious and
   non-infectious, can complicate the post-transplant course [[70]10,
   [71]11]. One report found that ARDS occurs in over 15% of patients
   undergoing allo-HSCT with ICU mortality rates of nearly 50% [[72]12].
   It remains unclear whether the pathobiology of ARDS following HSCT is
   similar to ARDS in other patient populations, even though ARDS post
   HSCT is often clinically indistinguishable from ARDS in non-HSCT
   patients. A better understanding of the biology of ARDS following
   allo-HSCT may lead to novel strategies for prevention and treatment in
   this population and, in addition, might identify broad treatment
   approaches for ARDS.

   Previous transcriptomic studies have used expression microarrays to
   search for ARDS gene-expression signatures. Using whole blood mRNA,
   Howrylak et al. identified a signature of 8 genes in ICU patients with
   sepsis that was associated with the development of ARDS [[73]13]. A
   microarray study of septic patients found increased expression of
   neutrophil related genes early in ARDS [[74]14], and our group
   demonstrated the critical role of IL18, a prominent
   inflammasome-related cytokine, in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced
   ARDS [[75]15]. In a study by Juss et al., peripheral blood neutrophils
   from ARDS patients were compared to those of healthy volunteers, and
   patients with ARDS had significant increases in immune response
   pathways [[76]16]. Published ARDS transcriptomic studies have not
   characterized different subgroups of patients with ARDS, an approach
   that may reveal distinct gene expression changes that underlie similar
   clinical symptoms. Here, we used RNA-Seq, a powerful and unbiased
   approach to characterize transcriptomes, to compare gene expression in
   the blood of patients with ARDS following allo-HSCT compared to
   patients with ARDS that had not undergone allo-HSCT.

Methods

Study design and sample collection

   Patients with ARDS following HSCT who contributed samples to the
   IRB-approved Brigham and Women’s Registry of Critical Illness (RoCI)
   from 2008 to 2013 were identified [[77]6, [78]17, [79]18]. All patients
   were admitted to the medical intensive care unit at Brigham and Women’s
   Hospital at the time of enrollment in the RoCI. Subjects with ARDS that
   did not undergo HSCT from the same 5 year period were then identified
   as a comparator group. To reduce sample heterogeneity, we selected
   subjects of similar age, time in the ICU, male sex, and white race.
   ARDS was defined by the Berlin [[80]1] definition for cases after 2012
   and the American-European Consensus (AECC) definition [[81]19] for
   cases prior to 2012. While our primary interest was identifying
   differences in gene expression in ARDS subjects that had undergone HSCT
   compared those without HSCT, we also sequenced 12 subjects with sepsis
   (HSCT and non-HSCT) without ARDS in order to identify differences
   between the ARDS groups that were not due to HSCT status. Sepsis was
   defined by the presence of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome
   (SIRS) with suspected or confirmed infection [[82]20]. Whole blood
   samples from the beginning of the ICU course (within the first 5 days
   of ICU admission) were used for gene expression profiling. Our overall
   study design is shown in Fig. [83]1.

   compared transcriptomic profiles of patients with ARDS compared to
   ARDS-HSCT (dark blue). In order to identify differences that were due
   to HSCT status, transcripts that were differentially regulated in
   sepsis patients compared to sepsis-HSCT (light blue) were excluded from
   the analysis

RNA-Seq library construction and sequencing

   RNA was extracted and globin-cleared using the Ambion GLOBINclear kit
   (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). RNA-Seq libraries were prepared with
   0.1–1 μg total RNA using Illumina TruSeq RNA-Seq v2 kit (Illumina, San
   Diego, CA) according to manufacturer protocol. Ambion External RNA
   Controls Consortium (ERCC) RNA Spike-In Control Mix 1 (Thermo Fisher,
   Waltham, MA) was added to the samples. Quality control of libraries
   involved picogreen and size analysis on an Agilent Bioanalyzer or
   Tapestation 2200 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and qPCR quantitation
   against a standard curve. Samples with an initial low RIN (i.e. < 6)
   were re-extracted; any samples with a persistent RIN < 6 were run in
   duplicate. Samples were randomized to one of 4 pools of 5–6 subjects,
   and each pool was sequenced in two different lanes. Sequencing of 75
   base pair, paired-end reads was performed with an Illumina HiSeq 2500
   instrument at Partners Personalized Medicine (Boston, MA) under rapid
   mode using PhiX spike-in and processed using Real-Time Analysis
   v1.18.64, Control Software v2.2.58 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).

RNA-Seq data analysis

   Preliminary processing of raw reads was performed using Casava 1.8
   (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Reads were aligned to the human genome build
   38 with STAR v2.4.0. [[85]21] Taffeta scripts
   ([86]https://github.com/blancahimes/taffeta) were used to assess
   quality of aligned reads, which included quantifying number of mapped
   reads, junction spanning reads, assessing 5′ and 3′ bias, and insert
   size distribution. For each sample, ERCC Spike-in dose response curves
   (i.e. plots of ERCC transcript FPKM vs. ERCC transcript molecules) were
   created following the manufacturer’s protocol [[87]22]. Because samples
   with low RIN (< 6) had characteristics similar to those of higher
   quality and duplicate samples were highly correlated, we combined data
   for duplicate samples and included them in further analyses. Raw read
   plots were created by displaying bigwig files for each sample in the
   UCSC Genome Browser. The RNA-Seq data is available at the Gene
   Expression Omnibus Web site ([88]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
   under accession [89]GSE84439. Gene counts were obtained with HTSeq
   v0.6.1. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2
   v1.12.3 [[90]23], after excluding reads mapped to hemoglobin genes and
   while adjusting for RIN scores as a covariate [[91]24]. The NIH
   Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)
   was used to perform gene ontological category enrichment analysis using
   Homo sapiens as background, and default options and annotation
   categories [[92]25].

qPCR validation of differentially expressed genes

   RNA (200 ng per subject) was used to prepare cDNA utilizing the Applied
   Biosciences High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcriptase Kit in 20 μl
   reactions (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). The cDNA was then used for qPCR
   analysis with the following Taqman/Applied Biosciences (Thermo Fisher,
   Waltham, MA) primers (all human and all primers chosen to span an exon
   junction): IFI44L (Hs00915292_m1), OAS2 (Hs00942643_m1), OAS3
   (Hs00196324_m1), SPATS2L (Hs91916364_m1). Briefly, qPCR was performed
   with a 1:5 dilution of cDNA and run for 40 cycles. All samples were run
   in triplicate, and GAPDH was used as a housekeeping control. All
   samples had SD < 0.5 between triplicates. Controls without cDNA
   templates, primers, and reverse transcriptase were included and were
   all appropriately negative. Delta CT values between genes of interest
   and GAPDH were analyzed for statistical significance using a t-test
   [[93]26].

Analysis of unmapped reads

   Fastq files containing paired-end reads were merged for each sample
   (i.e., forward and reverse sequence files were combined). Reads were
   trimmed with Trim Galore using a minimum Phred quality score of 20 and
   minimum final read length of 60 bp [[94]27]. Trimmed reads were
   de-duplicated to remove PCR artifacts and sequences containing at least
   one “N” was performed with Super-Deduper [[95]28]. Reads of potential
   human origin were removed by aligning resultant fastq files to GRCh37
   with STAR using the recommended default parameters [[96]21]. The
   unmapped (non-human) reads were taxonomically classified based on
   mapping all k-mers (k = 31) within each sequence to the lowest common
   ancestor in a database of > 83,000 bacterial, viral, fungal, and
   protozoan genomes in the OneCodex reference database (database version
   as of February 26, 2018). Default OneCodex alignment parameters were
   used [[97]29].

Results

Subject characteristics

   Characteristics of all subjects are shown in Table [98]1. To reduce
   sources of gene expression heterogeneity not related to disease status,
   selected subjects were age-matched, non-Hispanic white males with
   similar WBC, APACHE scores, and severity of hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2
   ratios) (Wilcoxon P > 0.1). For the HSCT-ARDS group, all patients had
   undergone HSCT for the treatment of various forms of acute leukemia and
   median time from transplant to development of ARDS was 117 days. All
   patients with ARDS received supportive care with low tidal volume
   ventilation and average tidal volumes did not differ between the ARDS
   and ARDS-HSCT at the time that blood samples were collected (Table
   [99]1). None of the ARDS subjects were treated with neuromuscular
   blockade or prone positioning at the time the blood sample used for RNA
   sequencing was collected. All HSCT-ARDS subjects were treated with
   corticosteroids (median dose 80 mg methylprednisolone daily), as were
   half of ARDS subjects (median dose 16 mg methylprednisolone daily).
   Similarly, in the non-ARDS control groups with sepsis, all of the
   sepsis-HSCT and half of the sepsis subjects were treated with
   corticosteroids. Etanercept was given to 4 of the 5 ARDS-HSCT patients
   as treatment for idiopathic pneumonia syndrome. Two ARDS subjects were
   confirmed to have influenza infection (Table [100]1). Patients with
   sepsis were managed with source control, early antibiotic
   administration, and volume resuscitation in accordance with sepsis
   guidelines at the time [[101]30, [102]31].

Immune response and interferon-stimulated genes are upregulated in ARDS
compared to ARDS-HSCT

   We identified 687 differentially expressed genes between ARDS and
   ARDS-HSCT (false-discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-value < 0.01). In
   ARDS-HSCT vs. ARDS, we found 687 differentially expressed genes (520
   were upregulated, 167 were downregulated, Fig. [104]2). To identify
   which differences in gene expression reflected unique features of
   ARDS-HSCT, rather than the history of HSCT itself, we filtered out
   genes that were also nominally differentially expressed (unadjusted
   p-value < 0.1) in a consistent direction in patients with sepsis-HSCT
   vs. sepsis. Of the 687 differentially expressed genes, 483 were not
   present in the sepsis-HSCT vs. sepsis comparison, suggesting that the
   majority of expression changes reflected processes unique to ARDS-HSCT.
   Top differentially expressed genes upregulated in ARDS vs. ARDS-HSCT
   included immune response and interferon signaling genes (e.g. IFI44L,
   OAS3, LY6E, OAS2, USP18) as shown in Table [105]2. Gene ontological
   category enrichment analysis with all 687 differentially expressed
   genes found that immune response- and interferon signaling-related
   pathways were statistically overrepresented (Table [106]3 and
   Additional file [107]1: Tables S1 to Table S3). To confirm top RNA-Seq
   results, we selected several of the most differentially expressed genes
   and performed qRT-PCR using an aliquot of whole blood RNA from the
   subjects that were sequenced. The qRT-PCR results were consistent with
   the RNA-Seq results and showed significant differences in expression
   for the transcripts that were tested (Additional file [108]2: Figure
   S1).

Differences in transcriptomic profiles are not due to influenza infection in
ARDS subjects

   To determine whether increased expression of immune response pathway
   genes in ARDS was due to viral infection, we repeated the differential
   expression analysis after excluding two patients with confirmed
   influenza infection (remaining ARDS subjects did not have any evidence
   of active viral infection while in the ICU). Results of this
   sub-analysis were consistent with those of the full set of subjects: of
   the top 100 genes differentially expressed in ARDS, 99 out of 100 were
   also differentially expressed after removal these two patients, and top
   results of the ontological category enrichment analysis were unchanged
   (Additional file [113]1: Table S2). Thus, it appears that increased
   expression of interferon-related genes in ARDS was not due to influenza
   infection.

Analysis of non-human transcripts did not show evidence of undiagnosed
infection in patients with ARDS after HSCT

   Some experts have speculated that lung injury following stem cell
   transplant may be due to infection with pathogens that are not
   identified using microbiologic techniques routinely used in clinical
   laboratories [[114]32]. For example, next-generation sequencing was
   used to discover a novel bacterium as a candidate pathogen in cord
   colitis syndrome, a complication of allogeneic cord blood HSCT
   [[115]33]. To investigate the possibility that undiagnosed infection
   accounts for differences observed in ARDS-HSCT, we used RNA-Seq reads
   that did not map to the human genome to perform genus-level taxonomic
   classification. After removing possible duplicate reads, we analyzed
   the remaining 8–19% of unmapped reads. Based on the genera present and
   relative similarity of microbial profiles across all 23 subjects, there
   were no significant differences between samples both within and among
   categories (Additional file [116]2: Figure S2). Additional file 1:
   Table S3 shows the number of reads per sample assignable to a virus. We
   detected the presence of virus in four subjects (with reads mapping to
   EBV and torquetenovirus). Only one subject had > 10 reads assignable to
   a virus (with 97 reads aligning to EBV). The lack of recurrent abundant
   pathogens in the ARDS HSCT population is consistent with clinical data
   and suggested that these patients did not have undiagnosed bacterial or
   viral bloodstream infections as a proximate cause of their ARDS.

Discussion

   We performed RNA-Seq using whole blood of patients with ARDS after HSCT
   and compared the transcriptomic profile to that of non-HSCT ARDS
   patients. Our analysis identified a set of differentially expressed
   genes with the strongest differences in pathways related to innate
   immune responses to pathogens and type I interferon signaling, all of
   which were upregulated in ARDS. Our findings raise the question of
   whether there may be an immune dysregulation post HSCT that predisposes
   subjects to lung injury or ARDS. Recently, Nick et al. found that high-
   and low- blood expression of a set of interferon-stimulated genes (MX1,
   IFIT1, and ISG15) identified a set of ARDS patients with worse
   outcomes. Morrell et al., analyzed peripheral blood monocyte gene
   expression by microarray and found increased interferon signaling in
   ARDS patients with a favorable outcome (i.e. more ventilator-free days)
   compared to ARDS patients with fewer ventilator-free days [[117]34].
   Thus, it is enticing to hypothesize that modulation of interferon
   signaling pathways represents a treatment approach for HSCT subjects,
   but additional data are required to support such a strategy.
   Interestingly, a recently completed phase 3 trial of human interferon
   beta 1a for moderate-to-severe ARDS did not find a significant
   difference in the primary composite endpoint of mortality and
   ventilator free days [[118]35, [119]36]. Although the administration of
   interferon beta 1a was not efficacious in this population of unselected
   patients, it is possible that assessing whether interferon signaling
   pathways are activated in ARDS patients might provide a more targeted
   approach to treatment.

   Our study is the first to use RNA-Seq in order to determine whether the
   specific ARDS subphenotype of HSCT-ARDS has a unique peripheral blood
   gene expression profile. Our patients were carefully selected from a
   single center and although sample size was small, this proof-of-concept
   study provides insights that are valuable to design future studies. We
   chose age- and sex-matched subjects to limit heterogeneity for this
   initial study, though we note that this may limit the generalizability
   of our findings. Another limitation of our study is the use of
   peripheral blood RNA, which is derived from a mixture of cell types.
   Although there were no significant differences in differential cell
   counts between groups, it is possible that gene expression profiles
   could be affected by subtle changes in cell maturity between groups.
   For example, blood gene expression profiles of patients with ARDS may
   have been dominated by systemic inflammation when compared to subjects
   without ARDS [[120]37]. We focused our study on two subgroups of ARDS
   patients, presumably with similar degrees of inflammation, in order to
   identify differences in gene expression that may explain heterogeneity
   amongst different types of ARDS patients. Our two groups were similar
   in demographic characteristics and severity of lung injury and overall
   illness, but still demonstrated clinical heterogeneity. While our
   results suggest that gene expression differences were not due to HSCT
   itself, we are unable to rule out the effect of potential confounders
   such as immunosuppressant medications. Notably, all of the patients in
   the ARDS-HSCT group were being treated with moderate-to-high dose
   corticosteroids at the time of inclusion, whereas half of the non-HSCT
   ARDS patients were on moderate dose corticosteroids. Another potential
   confounder is the possibility of undiagnosed infections. To address
   this issue, we analyzed reads from our RNA-Seq data that did not map to
   the human genome and performed taxonomic classification to look for the
   presence of common pathogens. Although our data did not suggest the
   presence of an undiagnosed bloodstream infection, this analysis was
   limited by the sample size, the fact that some respiratory pathogens
   might not exhibit a bloodstream signature, and the fact that the
   majority of bacterial RNA are not polyadenylated and may have been
   eliminated during the library preparation process. Finally, our samples
   were collected over the course of five years during which a new
   definition of ARDS was adopted, [[121]1] and thus, it is possible that
   multiple definitions could have unintentionally impacted our results.

   Patients who have undergone HSCT are at heightened risk for a number of
   types of lung injury including pulmonary infections as well as
   non-infectious lung injury such as drug-induced pneumonitis, diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome. Given the lack
   of well-defined diagnostic criteria for many of these entities, other
   investigators have focused on the epidemiology of the most severe form
   of lung injury (i.e. ARDS) regardless of the etiology and found that
   ARDS after allo-HSCT is common and has high mortality [[122]12]. We
   used a similar strategy for our study choosing not to focus on the
   proximal cause of lung injury. One limitation of this strategy is that
   it is difficult to determine whether the transcriptomic changes in the
   ARDS-HSCT population reflect the different underlying etiologies of
   ARDS, differential host responses, or most likely both. Interestingly,
   the majority of patients in the HSCT-ARDS group were suspected of
   having idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and received treatment with
   etanercept. While the effect of etanercept on peripheral blood gene
   expression in critical illness is not known, studies in autoimmune
   diseases have found differential regulation of interferon pathways. For
   example, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and IFI44L appear to be down-regulated by
   etanercept in responders to treatment for psoriasis [[123]38]. However,
   in a set of patients treated with infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis,
   treatment induced an increase in interferon response genes including
   OAS1 and OAS2 in a subset of patients who had poor clinical response;
   [[124]39] a subsequent study including patients on a variety of
   anti-TNF therapies including etanercept also found divergent responses
   in interferon profiles, though did not find an association with
   clinical response [[125]40].

Conclusions

   ARDS is a heterogeneous syndrome, with a diverse set of risk factors,
   etiologies, and outcomes. Our study is the first to identify a
   potential difference in gene expression that distinguishes ARDS-HSCT
   from ARDS, representing changes in immune response and interferon
   signaling pathways. Our data, along with existing literature, suggest
   that there is a spectrum of dysregulated interferon signaling
   underlying lung injury and further supports the notion that improved
   phenotyping of ARDS subgroups is critical for designing targeted
   treatments for this devastating syndrome. Importantly, our data raises
   the intriguing question of whether there exists a modifiable immune
   deficiency post-HSCT that ameliorates lung injury. Future studies to
   examine these areas are critically important.

   least genus-level specificity. Genera with minimum read fraction of 2%
   within a sample are displayed (otherwise collapsed into “Other”). No
   dramatic classwise differences are observed, and the lack of a
   recurrent abundant pathogen unique to ARDS-SCT patients suggests that
   undiagnosed bloodstream infection is an unlikely cause of ARDS in these
