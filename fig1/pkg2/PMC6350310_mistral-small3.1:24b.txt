Toxic stress response proteins were also more abundant in the UC patients compared to the control group. Toxic stress
   abundances was 10.2 (SD = 3.4). In the group with low cluster 1 protein abundances the average Geboes score was 6.9 (SD = 4.1). This indicates that NOS2 expression is increased in
   abundant in patients with higher inflammation scores. The NOS2 is a key
   nitric oxide (NO) in response to inflammation. NO can promote
   molecule. The increased NOS2 expression in the inflamed tissue is
   consistent with previous reports of increased NOS2 expression in inflamed tissue.
