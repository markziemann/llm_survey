Thinking...
We need to answer six questions about pathway enrichment analysis.

We must extract only explicit statements from article.

From Methods: "Functional annotation analysis was performed using DAVID based on Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway databases [47]^11^, [48]^12. The categories of KEGG Pathways served as background databases." Also "The breakpoints were annotated through the latest ANNOVAR in hg19 coordinates [49]^13."

Thus tool: DAVID. Also ANNOVAR used for annotation, but not enrichment. So only DAVID.

Version not described.

Gene set libraries: Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway databases. Also categories of KEGG pathways served as background. So GO and KEGG.

Custom or specific background: They said "The categories of KEGG Pathways served as background databases." That indicates a specific background: KEGG pathways categories used as background. So Yes (they used KEGG pathway categories as background). The question: "Does the article describe using a custom or specific background gene list for enrichment analysis?" Yes, they used KEGG pathway categories as background.

Statistical test(s) used: Not described. No mention of hypergeometric, Fisher, etc.

Multiple testing correction: Not described. No mention.

Thus produce table with columns: Question, Answer.

But they ask: "What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?: List all tools or software packages used (e.g., DAVID, GSEA, Enrichr, etc.) that are explicitly mentioned in the article for enrichment analysis."

So answer: DAVID.

"Were enrichment tool version(s) described?" -> Not described.

"Which gene set libraries were used?" -> Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway.

"Does the article describe using a custom or specific background gene list for enrichment analysis?" -> Yes.

"What statistical test(s) were used in enrichment analysis?" -> Not described.

"Was multiple testing correction / FDR applied to enrichment analysis?" -> Not described.

Provide table.

...done thinking.

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| **Tool(s) used for pathway enrichment analysis** | DAVID |
| **Enrichment tool version(s) described** | Not described |
| **Gene set libraries queried** | Gene Ontology (GO); KEGG pathway databases |
| **Custom or specific background gene list used?** | Yes (the authors state that “The categories of KEGG Pathways served as background databases.”) |
| **Statistical test(s) used for enrichment** | Not described |
| **Multiple‑testing correction / FDR applied?** | Not described |
