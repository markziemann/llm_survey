Abstract

Background

   Verticillium wilt (VW), also known as “cotton cancer,” is one of the
   most destructive diseases in global cotton production that seriously
   impacts fiber yield and quality. Despite numerous attempts, little
   significant progress has been made in improving the VW resistance of
   upland cotton. The development of chromosome segment substitution lines
   (CSSLs) from Gossypium hirsutum × G. barbadense has emerged as a means
   of simultaneously developing new cotton varieties with high-yield,
   superior fiber, and resistance to VW.

Results

   In this study, VW-resistant investigations were first conducted in an
   artificial greenhouse, a natural field, and diseased nursery
   conditions, resulting in the identification of one stably VW-resistant
   CSSL, MBI8255, and one VW-susceptible G. hirsutum, CCRI36, which were
   subsequently subjected to biochemical tests and transcriptome
   sequencing during V991 infection (0, 1, and 2 days after inoculation).
   Eighteen root samples with three replications were collected to perform
   multiple comparisons of enzyme activity and biochemical substance
   contents. The findings indicated that VW resistance was positively
   correlated with peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activity, but
   negatively correlated with malondialdehyde content. Additionally, RNA
   sequencing was used for the same root samples, resulting in a total of
   77,412 genes, of which 23,180 differentially expressed genes were
   identified from multiple comparisons between samples. After Gene
   Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment
   analysis on the expression profiles identified using Short Time-series
   Expression Miner, we found that the metabolic process in the biological
   process, as well as the pathways of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and
   plant hormone signal transduction, participated significantly in the
   response to VW. Gene functional annotation and expression quantity
   analysis indicated the important roles of the phenylpropanoid metabolic
   pathway and oxidation-reduction process in response to VW, which also
   provided plenty of candidate genes related to plant resistance.

Conclusions

   This study concentrates on the preliminary response to V991 infection
   by comparing the VW-resistant CSSL and its VW-susceptible recurrent
   parent. Not only do our findings facilitate the culturing of new
   resistant varieties with high yield and superior performance, but they
   also broaden our understanding of the mechanisms of cotton resistance
   to VW.

Background

   Cotton, as one of the most important commercial crops, is the most
   widely cultivated fiber plant globally, and it is of great economic and
   social significance [[70]1]. Despite being comprised of 46 diploid
   (2n = 2x = 26) and 5 allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 52) species, only 4
   Gossypium species are widely cultivated, namely, G. arboreum, G.
   herbaceum, G. hirsutum, and G. barbadense [[71]2]. As the major
   allotetraploid cotton species, upland cotton (G. hirsutum) and Sea
   Island cotton (G. barbadense) contribute more than 95% fiber capacity,
   and they originated from a hybridization event between G. arboreum
   (A[t]sub-genome) and G. raimondii (D[t] sub-genome) 1–2 million years
   ago [[72]3]. Verticillium wilt (VW), a representative vascular disease
   mainly caused by the infection of Verticillium dahliae Kleb., and the
   soil-borne fungus can cause leaf yellowing, wilt, defoliation, and even
   death [[73]4]. Cotton VW is the most destructive disease, presently
   tremendously affecting cotton yield and fiber performance [[74]5,
   [75]6].

   Initially described on upland cotton in 1914 in the USA, VW was
   subsequently introduced into China via the importation of American
   cotton species, resulting in substantial cotton yield losses [[76]7].
   Verticillium dahliae can cause wilt disease on more than 200 plant
   species, indicating its extensive range of host plants [[77]8, [78]9].
   The microsclerotia (melanized survival structures) formed by the
   soil-borne pathogen can survive in the soil for over 10 years, with
   germination being triggered by root exudate signals [[79]10, [80]11].
   Unfortunately, there are no appropriate commercial fungicides available
   for G. hirsutum, while G. barbadense, despite possessing innate
   resistance to VW and premium fiber quality, experiences low-fiber
   productivity upon infection [[81]12]. The above-mentioned conditions
   reduce the effectiveness of common cultivation practices, such as crop
   rotation, chemical fumigation, and soil conditioning [[82]13]. Thus,
   the development of new cotton cultivars possessing VW resistance by
   means of traditional breeding and transgenic strategies is the most
   practical and cost effective method to manage cotton VW
   [[83]14–[84]16]. Given the increasing human population and diminishing
   arable land, the development of novel varieties harboring high yield,
   superior fiber quality, and VW resistance remains a significant topic
   in cotton breeding. In response, chromosome segment substitution lines
   (CSSLs) have emerged as a means of combining the advantages of both
   upland and Sea Island cotton. Through conventional breeding methods,
   such as hybridization, backcrossing, selfing, and marker
   assisted-selection (MAS), CSSLs were developed as the ideal materials
   for further genome research and crop improvement. CSSLs have been
   preferentially applied to the quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping
   for essential traits, such as yield, quality, disease resistance, and
   stress tolerance in tomato [[85]17], wheat [[86]18], rice [[87]19,
   [88]20], and cotton [[89]21–[90]26].

   Plants have evolved two-layered immune mechanisms to protect themselves
   against various pathogens with different invasion strategies. The
   first-layer defense principally occurs on the extracellular surface of
   the host cell, where the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detect
   the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), further causing
   PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) by the stimulation of PRRs [[91]27,
   [92]28]. Although most pathogens are blocked by the basal immune
   response, some are able to successfully invade and suppress PTI through
   the deliverance of pathogenic effector proteins into the host cells via
   a type III secretion system (TTSS) [[93]29]. Subsequently, the specific
   resistance (R) genes encoding nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and
   leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains recognize these pathogen effectors,
   ultimately activating the second-layer defense mechanism, namely,
   effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [[94]27, [95]28]. Plant defense
   reactions in response to diverse pathogens are triggered along with the
   recognition of the PRRs and R genes, further causing a localized
   activation of programmed cell death (PCD), also known as the
   hypersensitive response (HR) [[96]30, [97]31]. Plenty of R proteins in
   plants share two typical domains: a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and a
   C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region [[98]32]. The former
   constitutes part of the nucleotide-binding (NB)-ARC adaptor shared by
   the apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF-1), R proteins, and
   Caenorhabditis elegans homolog domain 4 (CED-4) [[99]33], while the
   latter proteins play a central role in the biological processes of
   plant growth and development, including the immune response [[100]34].
   Based on the N-terminal domain categories, plant NBS-LRR proteins can
   be classified into toll/interleukin-1 receptors (TIR) and coiled-coil
   (CC), respectively referred to as TIR-NBS-LRR and CC-NBS-LRR [[101]35,
   [102]36].

   Along with the rapid development of next-generation sequencing
   technologies, diploid and allotetraploid Gossypium species have been
   successfully sequenced [[103]37–[104]42], which has improved our
   understanding of cotton polyploid properties and provided a solid
   foundation for further functional genomics. Transcriptome sequencing,
   also known as RNA-Seq, concentrates on gene expression and
   transcriptional regulation, making it suitable for revealing the
   molecular mechanisms of particular biological processes. RNA-Seq has
   been widely applied to identify the key signaling pathways or resistant
   genes in response to VW not only in cotton [[105]12, [106]43], but also
   in Nicotiana benthamiana [[107]44], smoke tree [[108]45], tomato
   [[109]46], sunflower [[110]47], and olive [[111]48]. Furthermore, the
   phenylalanine pathway, which includes lignin and flavonoid
   biosynthesis, has been reported to be associated with VW resistance and
   is similarly regulated by some enzyme activities and biochemical
   substances, including polyphenol oxidase (PPO), phenylalanine ammonia
   lyase (PAL), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and
   malondialdehyde (MAD) [[112]12, [113]43].

   In the present study, VW resistance investigations in artificial
   greenhouse, natural field, and disease nursery conditions were first
   conducted, and MBI8255, the VW-resistant CSSL, and CCRI36, the
   VW-susceptible recurrent parent, were subsequently used to perform
   biochemical tests during the preliminary stages of the V991 infection
   process (0, 1, and 2 days after inoculation, DAI), which included
   assessing the activities of CAT, POD, SOD, PAL, and PPO, and the
   contents of MDA, proline, soluble sugar, and soluble protein.
   Additionally, RNA-Seq was carried out on the same samples, and plenty
   of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) relevant to VW resistance were
   identified, which were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto
   Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. This
   report not only identified various candidate genes associated with VW
   resistance, but also identified the key signaling pathways in response
   to V991 infection, which should elucidate the molecular mechanisms of
   cotton VW resistance and provide a solid foundation for cotton breeding
   and genomics research.

Results

Phenotypic disease index (DI) in the greenhouse tests

   In order to evaluate the resistance to VW caused by V991, greenhouse
   tests with three replications of MBI8255, CCRI36, and two controls
   (Zhongzhimian2 and Jimian11) were conducted in 2015, with the
   phenotyping characterizations respectively collected at 15 and 30 DAI
   (Table [114]1). At 15 DAI, higher DI values were recorded in Jimian11
   (27.11%) and CCRI36 (15.38%), which are susceptible to VW, while lower
   DI values were found in the resistant Zhongzhimian2 (1.10%) and MBI8255
   (3.26%). Based on Least Significant Difference (LSD) tests at P = 0.05,
   no significant difference was observed between the DI values of the
   CSSL MBI8255 and resistant control Zhongzhimian2, which were
   significantly lower than those of the recurrent parent CCRI36 and the
   susceptible control Jimian11 (Fig. [115]1). Furthermore, a similar
   phenomenon arose in the DI values of the four materials at 30 DAI. The
   highest DI value was observed in Jimian11 (51.81%), while the lowest DI
   value was recorded in Zhongzhimian2 (16.18%). The second highest and
   lowest DI values were separately recorded in CCRI36 (45.67%) and
   MBI8255 (20.38%). Based on the LSD test, significant differences were
   found not only between MBI8266 and Zhongzhimian2, but also between
   CCRI36 and Jimian11, while the DI values of the former two were
   significantly lower than those of the latter two.

   Zhngzhimian2 and the susceptible Jimian11. Data were separately
   collected at 15 and 30 DAI. The error bars show the standard deviation
   and a, b, c indicate the significant differences in LSD tests in 15 and
   30 DAI, respectively

Phenotypic DI in the natural field and disease nursery tests

   To investigate VW resistance in the natural environment, natural field
   tests of MBI8255, CCRI36, and two controls (Zhongzhimian2 and Jimian11)
   were respectively performed in Anyang (Henan Province) with one
   replication and in Shihezi (Xinjiang Province) with one replication in
   2015, with the phenotypic identifications being separately carried out
   at the flowering and maturity stages (Table [118]1). In the field
   tests, the DI values of the two controls, Jimian11 and Zhongzhimian2,
   varied from 44.74 and 5.67% at the flowering stage to 53.41 and 17.05%
   at the maturity stage in Anyang, while those of MBI8255 and CCRI36
   varied from 6.73 and 27.89% at the flowering stage in Anyang to 23.91
   and 48.16%, respectively. With regards to the field tests in Xinjiang,
   the DI values of the VW-resistant Zhongzhimian2 and MBI8255 varied from
   1.12% and 0 to 27.49 and 29.69%, and those of the VW-susceptible
   Jimian11 and CCRI36 varied from 8.7 and 5.84% to 53.52 and 41.59%,
   respectively.

   Disease nursery tests were conducted to evaluate the DI values of
   MBI8255, CCRI36, and Jimian11 in Kaifeng (Henan Province) with one
   replication, and only the maturity stage was chosen to determine the
   phenotypic characteristics, ultimately resulting in DI values of 6.82,
   33.33, and 56.77%, respectively.

Biochemical responses to V991 infection in MBI8255 and CCRI36

   To explore the relationships between cotton VW and the specific
   signaling pathways or biochemical substances, biochemical tests of
   MBI8255 and CCRI36 in response to V991 infection were conducted on the
   enzyme activity or biochemical substances in the roots at 0, 1, and 2
   DAI. Three protective enzymes, namely, CAT, POD, and SOD, were chosen
   to analyze their activity changes during the process of V991 infection.
   The results are shown in Fig. [119]2a–c. CAT activity in the roots of
   CCRI36 gradually decreased from 0 DAI (26.42 U/g) to 2 DAI (13.28 U/g),
   but exhibited little change in the root samples of MBI8255, in which
   the highest and lowest activities occurred at 0 DAI (19.24 U/g) and 1
   DAI (17.62 U/g). The POD activity first increased from 0 DAI (1728 U/g)
   to 1 DAI (2389.33 U/g), and then decreased at 2 DAI (2109.33 U/g) in
   the roots of CCRI36, while an opposite trend was observed in POD
   activity in the MBI8255 root samples, which first declined from 0 DAI
   (2957.33 U/g) to 1 DAI (2189.33 U/g) and then peaked at 2 DAI
   (3528 U/g). In regard to root SOD, its activity in CCRI36 gradually
   increased from 0 DAI (289.49 U/g) to 2 DAI (334.37 U/g), with the roots
   of MBI8255 exhibiting the highest and lowest SOD activity at 1 DAI
   (295.18 U/g) and 2 DAI (350.17 U/g), respectively.

   Biochemistry analysis of MBI8255 and CCRI36 in response to V991
   infection. a-c: the activity changes of 3 protective enzymes relevant
   to VW resistance (CAT, POD and SOD) in root at 0, 1 and 2 DAI infected
   by V991. d-e: the activity changes of 2 defensive enzymes relevant to
   VW resistance (PAL and PPO) in root at 0, 1 and 2 DAI infected by V991.
   f-i: the content changes of 4 physiochemical substances relevant to VW
   resistance (MDA, Proline, soluble sugar and soluble protein) in root at
   0, 1 and 2 DAI infected by V991. Three biological replications were
   performed and the error bars represent the standard deviation

   Two defense enzymes relevant to VW resistance, namely, PAL and PPO,
   were also selected to investigate the activity changes following V991
   infection (Fig. [122]2d–e). Only the PAL and PPO changes in the roots
   of CCRI36 showed a similar trend, first increasing from 3.94 U/g and
   28.32 U/g at 0 DAI to 5.61 U/g and 39.83 U/g at 1 DAI, and then
   declining to 5.45 U/g and 38.4 U/g at 2 DAI, respectively. The high PAL
   activity of the roots of MBI8255 at 0 DAI (5.92 U/g) dropped to the
   lowest value at 1 DAI (5.29 U/g), and then rose to 5.55 U/g at 2 DAI,
   while the PPO activity in the roots of MBI8255 rose from the lowest
   value of 33.12 U/g at 0 DAI to the highest value of 48.48 U/g at 2 DAI.

   Similarly, the contents of MDA, proline, soluble sugar, and soluble
   protein were assessed in the roots during V991 infection (Fig.
   [123]2f–i). Similar variation patterns were observed in both MDA and
   proline contents in the roots of the two lines, which showed a gradual
   decrease in CCRI36, whereas MBI8255 initially rose and then declined.
   The highest and lowest MDA contents in CCRI36 were 6 nmol/g at 0 DAI
   and 4.29 nmol/g at 2 DAI, respectively, while those in MBI8255 were
   15.43 nmol/g at 1 DAI and 9.43 nmol/g at 0 DAI, respectively. The
   maximum and minimum proline values in CCRI36 were 8.87 μg/g at 0 DAI
   and 7.73 μg/g at 2 DAI, respectively, while those in MBI8255 were 8.65
   μg/g at 1 DAI and 6.78 μg/g at 2 DAI, respectively. The soluble sugar
   content of the roots of CCRI36 increased from 5.76 mg/g at 0 DAI to
   6.59 mg/g at 1 DAI, and then declined to 5.75 mg/g at 2 DAI. The
   soluble sugar content in MBI8255 showed a gradual increase from
   4.07 mg/g at 0 DAI to 6 mg/g at 2 DAI. The soluble protein content in
   the roots of CCRI36 first rose from 1.31 mg/g at 0 DAI to 1.55 mg/g at
   1 DAI and then declined to 1.50 mg/g at 2 DAI, while MBI8255 showed an
   opposite pattern, decreasing from 1.79 mg/g at 0 DAI to 1.54 mg/g and
   then increasing to 1.63 mg/g at 2 DAI.

Transcriptome sequencing and alignment to the G. hirsutum genome

   In this study, 18 RNA-Seq libraries were constructed from root samples
   infected by V991, which were collected at 0, 1, and 2 DAI in MBI8255
   and CCRI36 with three biological replications, with the aim of
   systematically identifying the key genes or pathways affecting cotton
   resistance to VW. In total, 922.867 million raw reads were obtained,
   which were filtered for low-quality reads, resulting in 908.547 million
   clean reads (approximately 136.27 Gb data) with an average of 7.57 G
   per library (Table [124]2). Over 91.38% of the Q30 values and no less
   than 43.44% of the GC content were calculated from the RNA-Seq results,
   of which the average values were 92.23 and 43.68%, respectively.
   Subsequently, the clean reads were mapped to the G. hirsutum genome
   using TopHat2 software, and 87.69–91.23% of the clean data were
   successfully matched to the reference genome, of which 79.13–84.29% and
   6.63–8.39% constituted unique and multiple reads, respectively. All of
   the above-mentioned results implied the reliability of our
   transcriptome results.

   A total of 77,412 genes containing 6934 novel genes were found in our
   RNA-Seq results, of which the expression quantities were subsequently
   evaluated based on the Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million
   mapped reads (FPKM) value. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)
   analysis was used to calculate the correlations between the 18
   experimental samples, approximately resulting in more than 93.9%
   similarity in the gene expressions of each sample based on three
   replications; however, exceptions were observed for 82.5 and 84% of
   similarities separately identified between CCRI36–2 III and CCRI36–2
   I/CCRI36–2 II (Fig. [126]3). We found 92.4–97% similarity between the
   gene profiles of CCRI36 and MBI8255 at 0 DAI, whereas the similarities
   were 85.7–91.6% and 89–91.5%, respectively, at 1 and 2 DAI, which
   suggested that the two lines at the same stages of V991 infection
   exhibited a similar gene expression pattern even though the
   similarities at 1 and 2 DAI were lower than those at 0 DAI. A gradual
   decrease in expressed gene similarity was observed between CCRI36–0 and
   CCRI36–1/CCRI36–2, first declining from 0 DAI to 1 DAI and then
   increasing at 2 DAI in MBI8255. The differences between the two lines
   might result from the CSSL with distinct G. barbadense chromosomal
   segments.

Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)

   To investigate the differential responses to V991 infection, three
   replications per sample in the two lines were merged to conduct
   pairwise comparisons, and DEGs were identified by DESeq R package
   (v1.18.0) and were based on the Q-value, with a false discovery rate
   (FDR)-adjusted cut-off value of < 0.01 and an absolute
   log[2]Change ≥ 2. A total of 23,180 genes containing 1816 novel genes
   were differentially expressed in response to V991 infection
   (Additional file [129]1). These were subjected to GO enrichment
   analysis (Fig. [130]4). Forty-six subcategories were clustered into
   three categories, specifically biological process, cellular component,
   and molecular function, and the primary enriched groups in these
   categories were metabolic process and cellular process, cell and cell
   part, and binding and catalytic activity.

   The GO enrichment analysis of the total differentially expressed genes

   The results of the pairwise comparisons were as follows (Fig. [133]5):
   1424 DEGs from CCRI36–0 vs. MBI8255–0, 8122 DEGs from CCRI36–0 vs.
   CCRI36–1, 167 DEGs from CCRI36–1 vs. CCRI36–2, 16,441 DEGs from
   MBI8255–0 vs. MBI8255–1, 4555 DEGs from MBI8255–1 vs. MBI8255–2, 8546
   DEGs from MBI8255–1 vs. CCRI36–1, and 1110 DEGs from MBI8255–2 and
   CCRI36–2. Based on the comparisons between CCRI36–0 vs. CCRI36–1 and
   CCRI36–1 vs. CCRI36–2 (Fig. [134]6a), 53 DEGs were commonly identified,
   while 2644 common DEGs were found in the comparisons of MBI8255–0 vs.
   MBI8255–1 and MBI8255–1 vs. MBI8255–2 (Fig. [135]6b). There were 450
   and 211 common DEGs identified from the comparisons between CCRI36–0
   vs. MBI8255–0 and CCRI36–1 vs. MBI8255–1/CCRI36–2 vs. MBI8255–2 (Fig.
   [136]6c), respectively, while 508 common DEGs were observed between
   CCRI36–1 vs. MBI8255–1 and CCRI36–2 vs. MBI8255–2, ultimately
   identifying 115 common genes derived from all of the above comparisons.

Analysis of gene temporal expression patterns

   To investigate the temporal patterns of all the 23,180 DEGs, Short
   Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) analyses were conducted in the two
   lines. In total, 19,044 DEGs in CCRI36 and 20,316 DEGs in MBI8255 were
   clustered into eight profiles (Fig. [140]7), with each profile
   representing a group of genes with a similar expression pattern
   (Additional file [141]2). Among the CCRI36 profiles, 11,827 DEGs (62.1%
   of 19,044) were further clustered into three profiles (P-value ≤0.05),
   including one up-regulated pattern, namely, profile 7 (6024 DEGs,
   31.63%), and two down-regulated patterns, namely, profile 2 (4142 DEGs,
   21.75%) and profile 1 (1481 DEGs, 7.78%). Similarly, 13,598 DEGs
   (66.93% of the 20,316 DEGs) in MBI8255 were clustered into three
   profiles (P-value ≤0.05). Up-regulated profile 7 and down-regulated
   profile 2 contained 5912 (29.12%) and 5288 (26.03%) DEGs, while
   profile 0 (2393 DEGs, 11.78%) first decreased and then increased in
   expression levels.

   square represents a trend of gene expression. The number in top left
   corner indicates the profile ID number, and the number in bottom left
   corner indicates the number of gens in that profile. The clusters and
   profiles were ordered based on the number of genes and significance
   (default), respectively

   Next, GO enrichment analysis was conducted to identify the putative
   functional genes from the profiles in the two lines. Profile 7 and
   profile 2 possessed the most DEGs with significant values (P-value
   ≤0.05) among the eight profiles (Fig. [143]8). All of the DEGs were
   classified into three main categories consisting of biological process,
   molecular function, and cellular component. In combination with the GO
   term results of the two profiles in CCRI36 and MBI8255, metabolic
   process and cellular process were the dominant subcategories in
   biological process, while binding and catalytic activity were the most
   abundant subcategories in molecular function, and cell part and cell
   were the top two abundant subcategories in cellular component. In the
   up-regulated profile 7, more DEGs clustered into the subcategories in
   CCRI36 than in MBI8255, while on the contrary, a greater number of DEGs
   clustered into the same subcategories in MBI8255 than in the
   down-regulated profile 2.

   GO classification of profile7 and profile2 in two lines (CCRI36 and

   Similarly, the above-mentioned two profiles in CCRI36 and MBI8255 were
   subjected to KEGG pathway analysis, and the 20 top signaling pathways
   with the greatest number of DEGs are shown in Table [146]3. For the
   up-regulated pattern of profile 7, eight common pathways were
   significantly enriched in the two lines, namely, phenylpropanoid
   biosynthesis (ko00940), plant hormone signal transduction (ko04075),
   circadian rhythm-plant (ko04712), flavonoid biosynthesis (ko00941),
   stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis (ko00945),
   limonene and pinene degradation (ko00903), galactose metabolism
   (ko00380), and carotenoid biosynthesis (ko00052). In addition to the
   above-mentioned pathways, there were only three significantly enriched
   pathways in CCRI36, including amino sugar and nucleotide sugar
   metabolism (ko00520), glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (ko00010), and
   tryptophan metabolism (ko00240). The most enriched pathway in profile 7
   of the two lines was similarly annotated to starch and sucrose
   metabolism (ko00500), while the smallest P-value pathways were
   separately identified as flavonoid biosynthesis in CCRI36 and as
   phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in MBI8255.

   “*” means the significantly enriched pathways

   In the down-regulated profile 2, only two common enriched pathways with
   significance, namely, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and plant hormone
   signal transduction, were observed in the two lines, with the latter
   pathway indicating not only the smallest P-values in both CCRI36 and
   MBI8255, but also the greatest number of DEGs in MBI8255. Starch and
   sucrose metabolism was the most enriched pathway in profile 2 of
   CCRI36. Compared to the pathways in profile 2 of CCRI36, circadian
   rhythm-plant, flavonoid biosynthesis, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and
   gingerol biosynthesis, and limonene and pinene degradation were the
   significantly enriched pathways in MBI8255 only.

Expression profiling of DEGs related to the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway

   During the process of plant growth and development, some
   phenylpropanoid metabolites differentially accumulate in particular
   cells or tissues, such as the lignins deposited in the xylem tissue and
   vascular bundles and the flavonoids concentrated in the vacuolar and
   wall compartments, which has been reported to play important roles in
   plant defense [[148]49, [149]50]. The expression profiles of key enzyme
   genes involved in lignin and flavonoid biosynthesis were evaluated in
   this study (Fig. [150]9). The majority of up-regulated genes were
   related to lignin biosynthesis and the majority of down-regulated genes
   were related to flavonoid biosynthesis in the two lines during the
   preliminary stages of V991 infection (Additional file [151]3).

   The expression of DEGs related with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis
   pathway. Red and blue numbers represent the DEGs from MBI8255 and

   At the beginning of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (from phenylalanine to
   p-coumaroyl CoA), the genes of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL),
   cinnamic acid.

   4-hydroxylase (C4H), and 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-Coa ligase (4CL) exhibited
   almost no change from 0 DAI to 2 DAI in the two lines, except for
   down-regulation following the up-regulation of CCRI36 C4H and the
   continuous up-regulation of MBI8255 4CL. In the flavonoid biosynthesis
   pathway, the genes of chalcone synthase (CHS) and flavanone
   3-hydroxylas (F3H) were persistently up-regulated, while the chalcone
   isomerase (CHI) and flavonol synthase (FLS) genes showed no significant
   change in the two lines, except for the continuous down-regulation of
   the FLS gene in CCRI36. With regards to lignin biosynthesis,
   continuously up-regulated expression patterns in the two lines were
   observed in the genes of cinnamoyl-CoA:NADPH oxidoreductase (CCR),
   coumarate-3-hydroxylase (C3H), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyl-transferase
   (CCoAOMT), hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase
   (HCT), and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), while the caffeic acid
   O-methyltransferase (COMT) and coniferaldehyde/ferulate 5-hydroxylase
   (F5H) genes were down-regulated and exhibited little change from 0 DAI
   to 2 DAI. In MBI8255, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate
   hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), laccase (LAC), and POD genes were
   first up-regulated and then down-regulated. In contrast, the former
   exhibited no change in CCRI36, while the latter two were up-regulated.

Expression profiling of the DEGs involved in oxidation-reduction processes

   Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported to play significant
   roles in plant growth, development, and stress defense [[154]51] and
   control redox homeostasis balance between ROS-producing and
   ROS-scavenging pathways. Based on the GO enrichment analysis in all of
   the DEGs, 1433 DEGs were found to participate in the
   oxidation-reduction process (GO: 0055114), which served as the basis
   for all the downstream analyses of ROS-related genes (Fig. [155]10).

   The heatmap analysis of genes related with oxidation-reduction process.
   a represents the expression patterns of genes related with
   ROS-producing pathways, (b) and (c) represent the expression patterns
   of genes related with ROS-scavenging pathways

   NADPH oxidases, also known as respiratory burst oxidase homologs
   (RBOHs), play significant roles in the generation of ROS in plants
   [[158]52]. In the present study, a total of 11 Rboh-like protein genes
   were identified, namely, 2 RbohB, 5 RbohD, and 4 RbohF in the
   oxidation-reduction process, with the former 2 mostly showing
   up-regulated patterns and the latter being down-regulated in response
   to V991 infection in the two lines.

   Simultaneously, expression pattern analysis was also conducted on the
   DEGs involved in ROS scavenging pathways. Sixteen ascorbate peroxidase
   (APX) protein genes were identified that were mostly down-regulated in
   the two lines. There were eight SOD genes identified from our RNA-Seq
   data, most of which were first down-regulated and then up-regulated in
   CCRI36, but down-regulated in MBI8255. However, the two SOD genes
   annotated as copper/zine SOD 1 and manganese SOD 1 presented continuous
   up-regulation in CCRI36 and down-regulation following up-regulation in
   MBI8255, which was consistent with the aforementioned biochemical
   investigations of root SOD. Five catalase (CAT) genes were mostly
   down-regulated in CCRI36 and first down-regulated and then up-regulated
   in MBI8255, which corroborated the aforementioned CAT investigations.
   One glutaredoxin (GRX) gene exhibited no significant change in CCRI36,
   but presented a down-regulated pattern in MBI8255. In addition, the
   genes of eight monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR), seven glutathione
   peroxidase (GPX), and three peroxiredoxin (PrxR) genes were mainly
   down-regulated in CCRI36, but showed up-regulation following
   down-regulation in MBI8255. In both lines, one ferritin and three
   thioredoxin (Trx) genes presented up-regulated expression patterns,
   while most of the four alternative oxidase (AOX) genes were first
   down-regulated and then up-regulated. The correlation of all of the
   complicated and diverse changes in the above-mentioned genes with
   ROS-producing and ROS-scavenging pathways indicated that the
   oxidation-reduction process plays extraordinary roles in maintaining
   the redox homeostasis balance under V991 infection.

Expression profiling of DEGs relevant to plant resistance

   Based on the GO enrichment analysis on all the DEGs, a total of 182
   DEGs were enriched in the biological process of defense response
   (GO:0006952) and were further analyzed in combination with the
   functional annotation of A. thaliana, eventually obtaining 158
   immunity-related DEGs (Fig. [159]11). In the present study, most DEGs
   associated with plant resistance to VW were annotated as R genes, which
   were classified into CC-NBS-LRR and TIR-NBS-LRR genes. Eleven
   CC-NBS-LRR protein genes were identified, of which Gh_D05G0053 and
   Gh_D05G3603 with relatively high levels gradually increased in the two
   lines (except for Gh_D05G0053 from 1 DAI to 2 DAI). There were 25 genes
   encoding TIR-NBS-LRR proteins, and four highly expressed genes were
   observed, namely, Gh_A10G2076, Gh_A09G2289, Gh_D03G1355, and
   Gh_A11G2680. The first and middle two genes were separately
   up-regulated and down-regulated after being first up-regulated in both
   lines, while the last gene showed continuous down-regulation in MBI8255
   and up-regulation following down-regulation in CCRI36. In addition to
   the above-mentioned NBS-LRR proteins, we also found 22 genes encoding
   LRR and NB-ARC domain-containing disease resistance proteins and 42
   genes encoding an NB-ARC domain-containing disease resistance protein
   in this GO term. Among the LRR and NB-ARC genes, Gh_D05G2688 and
   Gh_D03G1527 exhibited extremely high expression levels, with the former
   being first up-regulated and then down-regulated in the two lines,
   while the latter was up-regulated following down-regulation in CCRI36
   and down-regulation following up-regulation in MBI8255. As for the
   NB-ARC genes, Gh_D11G3200 exhibited the highest expression and was
   first up-regulated and then down-regulated in the two lines.

   The expression pattern analysis of genes related with Defense response

   Many other genes participate in plant resistance to VW, the expression
   patterns of which were further analyzed as follows. Activated disease
   resistance 1 (ADR1) genes, including ADR1, ADR1-like1, and ADR1-like2,
   were correlated with the regulation of the basal and ETI mediated
   defense in Arabidopsis [[162]53]. Four ADR1-like1 genes were
   identified, namely, Gh_A01G0964, Gh_A05G1718, Gh_D05G2487, and
   Gh_D01G1013, in which the transcription patterns were mostly
   up-regulated in CCRI36 and down-regulated following up-regulation in
   MBI8255.

   MOS2, also described as a D111/G-patch domain-containing protein, is
   essential for innate immunity in A. thaliana [[163]54]. One MOS2 gene,
   Gh_A05G2156, was continuously down-regulated in the two lines, the
   expression level of which in MBI8255 was higher than in CCRI36, not
   only at 0 DAI but also at 1 DAI.

   ZED1, also known as HOPZ-ACTIVARED RESISTANCE 1, is responsible for
   high temperature-dependent autoimmunity and growth retardation in
   zed1-D [[164]55]. Two ZED1 genes, identified as Gh_A12G0580 and
   Gh_D12G0592, presented a gradually increasing expression level from 0
   DAI to 2 DAI in the two lines.

   Major latex protein (MLP)-like proteins belong to the Bet v 1 family,
   also described as the pathogenesis related 10 (RP 10)-like protein
   family, the expression patterns of which are related to defense or
   stress responses [[165]56]. Gh_A01G1247, Gh_D01G1452, and Gh_D02G1447
   were annotated as MLP-like protein 28 genes, of which the former two
   were up-regulated following down-regulation (except for down-regulation
   in Gh_A01G1247), whereas the latter was up-regulated from 0 DAI to 2
   DAI in the two lines. Eight MLP-like 34 were identified, and the
   expression levels of Gh_D02G1410, Gh_D02G1446, and Gh_D07G2407 were
   relatively high in comparison to the remainder of the genes, with the
   former two being up-regulated and the latter being first down-regulated
   and then up-regulated in response to V991 infection in CCRI36 and
   MBI8255. There were 12 MLP-like 423 genes, and Gh_D02G0560 had
   extremely high RPKM values relative to the remainder, indicating
   up-regulation following down-regulation in both lines.

   Three genes related to Arabidopsis pathogenesis-related 4 [[166]57]
   were found, and the transcript level of Gh_D11G2592 was relatively high
   compared to Gh_A11G2286 and Gh_D11G2595, which were first up-regulated
   and subsequently down-regulated in CCRI36. In contrast, these were
   continuously up-regulated in MBI8255, obtaining higher expression
   levels in the VW-resistant line than the VW-susceptible line at 2 DAI.

   A resistance (R) gene in rice belonging to P-loop containing the
   nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases superfamily protein has been
   implicated in the signaling pathways of the rice blast (Magnaporthe
   grisea) resistance reaction [[167]58]. Four P-loops containing
   nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases superfamily protein genes, including
   Gh_A11G2323, Gh_A12G1867, Gh_A12G1852, and Gh_D12G2022, were
   identified, and the former two presented up-regulation after
   down-regulation, while the latter two were gradually up-regulated in
   CCRI36. In contrast, the first gene was up-regulated following
   down-regulation, the second and forth were down-regulated after being
   up-regulated, while the third was continuously down-regulated in
   MBI8255.

   Pyrabactin resistance (PYR)/PYR1-like (PYL)/regulatory components of
   ABA receptors (RCAR) belong to the ABA receptor family, and ABA plays
   significant roles in plant abiotic stress resistance [[168]59]. One
   PYL2 gene, Gh_A04G0244, was up-regulated in CCRI36, but was
   down-regulated after being up-regulated in MBI8255.

   Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae 5 (RPS5), encoding the coiled-coil
   nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR) domain,
   recognizes the Avirulence effector protein Pseudomonas phaseolocola B
   (AvrPphB) from Pseudomonas syringae [[169]60, [170]61]. Two RPS5-like
   genes were found in the results, namely, Gh_A11G2559 and Gh_D05G3479,
   of which the former with higher FPKM values than the latter was
   up-regulated in CCRI36, but down-regulated following up-regulation in
   MBI8255.

   The mildew locus O (MLO) gene family, ubiquitously found in most land
   plants, encodes seven transmembrane (TM) domain proteins that
   participate in the regulation of defense and cell death in response to
   biotic and abiotic stress [[171]62]. Fifteen genes annotated as MLO
   family proteins demonstrated diverse expressional abundances.
   Gh_D02G0670 and Gh_D06G2377 had relatively high RPKM values and were
   first up-regulated and then down-regulated in the two lines, except for
   the latter, which was consistently up-regulated in CCRI36.
   Interestingly, the expression levels in MBI8255 were higher than in
   CCRI36, except for Gh_D02G0670 at 2 DAI.

   The target of AvrB operation 1 (TAO1), belonging to the TIR-NB-LRR
   protein family, was reported to contribute to disease resistance in
   response to the Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrB in A. thaliana
   [[172]63]. Two TAO1 genes were identified, and Gh_D06G2323 was first
   up-regulated and then down-regulated in the two lines and exhibited
   significantly higher expression levels than Gh_A12G0912.

Validation of the RNA-Seq results by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR

   To confirm the reliability of our RNA-Seq results, 20 DEGs were
   randomly selected for qRT-PCR (Fig. [173]12). The primer sets are
   listed in Table [174]4. The reference gene was the house-keeping
   β-Actin gene, and the expression patterns of the 20 genes in the
   qRT-PCR results were highly consistent with the transcriptome
   sequencing data, which further supported the reliability of our RNA-Seq
   data.

Discussion

Experimental conditions and phenotypic evaluation

   In the present study, VW resistance evaluations were conducted on the
   CSSL, its recurrent parent, and the two controls under the artificial
   greenhouse, natural field, and disease nursery tests. The disease index
   can be calculated based on the number of leaves with symptoms of
   necrosis and chlorosis. Although three replications in the greenhouse
   tests were carried out with different numbers of paper cups (five
   seedlings per cup; the first replication included five cups, the second
   replication included seven cups, and the third replication contained 10
   cups), the total number of seedlings for either the resistant control
   (Zhongzhimian2) or the susceptible control (Jimian11) was sufficient
   for the disease evaluation. This not only increases the accuracy, but
   also reduces the experimental error. Based on the greenhouse results,
   the DI values of MBI8255 and CCRI36 were relatively close to those of
   Zhongzhimian2 and Jimian11 at 15 DAI, respectively. A similar
   phenomenon was observed at 30 DAI, even though higher DI values were
   observed than at 15 DAI, which indicated that the selected CSSL and its
   recurrent parent were separately resistant and susceptible to V991.

   In the natural field tests, the VW resistance evaluations were
   performed on the four lines as in the greenhouse investigations in two
   different locations (one replication in Anyang and one replication in
   Xinjiang), and were investigated at the flowering and maturation
   stages. The two resistant lines (MBI8255 and Zhongzhimian2) and two
   susceptible lines (CCRI36 and Jimian11) in Anyang presented relatively
   close DI values at both the flowering and mature stages. A similar
   trend was observed in Xinjiang, whereby MBI8255 exhibited VW
   resistance, while CCRI36 demonstrated VW susceptibility in the natural
   environment. The four lines in Anyang showed higher DI values than
   those in Xinjiang at the flowering stage, but presented relatively low
   DI values in Anyang at the mature stage, except in CCRI36. These
   variations in the field results could be attributed to a variety of
   factors, such as the infection of plants by a combination of VW
   strains, different locations with diverse quantities and virulence
   levels of soil fungus, and various developmental and environmental
   conditions [[178]64]. For the disease nursery tests, only one replicate
   of MBI8255, CCRI36, and Jimian11 was conducted in Kaifeng, while the
   susceptible control showed 56.77% DI, which was slightly higher than in
   either the greenhouse or field tests. Although presenting a more
   similar DI to that at 15 DAI or the flowering stage of the greenhouse
   and field tests, MBI8255 and CCRI36 separately exhibited resistance and
   susceptibility to VW, which might be due to the insufficient number of
   sampled plants. In combination with the greenhouse, field, and disease
   nursery results, the selected CSSL, MBI8255, proved to be resistant to
   VW despite showing a slightly higher DI than the resistant control,
   Zhongzhimian2. Conversely, the recurrent parent, CCRI36, was
   susceptible to VW despite demonstrating a slightly lower DI than the
   susceptible control, Jimian11, which provided a solid foundation for
   further biochemical tests and transcriptome sequencing.

Biochemical mechanisms of resistance to V991 infection

   As a result of long-term interactions with diverse pathogens, plants
   have evolved many strategies to prevent damage or invasion by microbes,
   including plant physical defense responses and physiological and
   biochemical resistance, of which the regulation of antioxidant enzymes
   and the synthesis of biochemical substances is of great significance.
   ROS have been shown to mediate signal transduction and regulate
   homeostasis as key secondary messengers, high concentrations of which
   could result in membrane damage and the destruction of cellular
   organelles and biomolecules, ultimately causing cell death [[179]65].
   In order to repair the damage caused by ROS in response to pathogen
   infection, plants enhance the activities of antioxidative enzymes, such
   as CAT, SOD, POD, and PPO. In addition to the above-mentioned enzymes,
   PAL is also an essential enzyme that is correlated with the synthesis
   of lignin and suberin and plays a key role in the regulation of the
   synthesis of salicylic acid (SA) and the establishment of systemic
   acquired resistance (SAR) [[180]66]. With regards to the VW caused by
   V. dahliae, the POD, PAL, and PPO activities were positively correlated
   with VW resistance in eggplant [[181]67], and the former two were
   strengthened after inoculation with the V991 strain in cotton
   [[182]43]. To evaluate the relationships between key enzymes and VW
   resistance, three protective enzymes (CAT, SOD, and POD) and two
   defense enzymes (PAL and PPO) were selected and tested on root samples
   collected at 0, 1, and 2 DAI in MBI8255 and CCRI36. According to the
   activity results of the protective enzymes (Fig. [183]2), the
   activities of the VW-resistant and VW-susceptible lines at the same
   stage showed no significant difference either in root CAT or root SOD,
   which indicated that no correlation between VW resistance and CAT
   activity or SOD activity was detected in the present study. However,
   significant differences were observed in POD activity between MBI8255
   and CRI36 at the same stage, except at 1 DAI, which implied a close
   relationship between POD activity and VW resistance. Furthermore, POD
   activity in MBI8255 was significantly higher than in CCRI36 at 0 and 2
   DAI, which indicated that in comparison to the susceptible recurrent
   parent, the resistant CSSL possessed higher POD activity regardless of
   V991 infection. With regards to the two defense enzymes, only PPO
   activity in the two lines at 2 DAI differed significantly, while the
   VW-resistant line presented higher PAL and POD activities than the
   VW-susceptible line, except for PAL activity at 1 DAI. This indicated a
   clear correlation between VW resistance and POD activity, and
   furthermore, that the resistant line had higher PAL and POD activity in
   response to V991 infection. Based on the above results, the POD and PPO
   activities were positively correlated with VW resistance, which was
   consistent with the findings of a previous study [[184]43, [185]67].
   However, sufficient evidence is lacking to prove a close correlation
   between PAL activity and VW resistance, although higher activities were
   identified in the resistant line, which did not corroborate previous
   studies. One reason might be related to the complicated background of
   the selected CSSL, which should be addressed in further research.

   Some biochemical substances in plants provide energy for the
   self-defense response or are the products of damage and injury caused
   by pathogen invasion, including MDA [[186]68, [187]69], proline
   [[188]70, [189]71], and soluble sugar [[190]72], which are correlated
   with plant resistance. As the final product of lipid peroxidation, the
   root MDA contents in the two lines showed significant differences at
   the same stage and a down-regulated pattern, except at 0 DAI, and
   presented higher contents in MBI8255, which might indicate a negative
   correlation with VW resistance. However, an obvious correlation between
   VW resistance and the contents of proline, soluble sugar, and soluble
   protein was not detected, and no significant differences were found
   between either the two lines at the same stage, or between MBI8255 or
   CCRI36 at the different stages. Our results corroborated previous
   studies [[191]43, [192]67], thereby providing useful information for
   the further analysis of the combination with our RNA-Seq data.

Gene expression variation in response to V991 infection

   RNA-Seq, as a powerful tool focused on global gene expression at the
   transcriptome level, can reveal the mechanisms of particular biological
   processes and was utilized to identify the key candidate genes or
   significant signaling pathways in response to VW in the present study.
   Eighteen root samples derived from the VW-resistant MBI8255 and
   VW-susceptible CCRI36 were collected at 0, 1, and 2 DAI of V991
   infection. Library construction and transcriptome sequencing of these
   samples produced a total of 908.547 million clean reads (approximately
   136.27 Gb data) with more than 91.38% of the Q30 value and over 43.44%
   of the GC content. No less than 87.69% of the clean reads were
   successfully mapped to the reference genome and were subsequently
   subjected to assembly, ultimately obtaining 77,412 genes, including
   6934 novel genes. PCC analyses were used to confirm the relationships
   of the different samples, and high similarities were found among the
   three replicates of each sample and also in the samples from the same
   stages, which confirmed the reliability of our RNA-Seq data.

   Through multiple comparisons between the samples, 23,180 genes (1816
   novel genes) were differentially expressed in response to V991
   infection, with more down-regulated genes than up-regulated genes
   observed. Adopting STEM analysis to investigate the temporal expression
   patterns of the total DEGs, three profiles (P ≤ 0.05) per line were
   identified, and GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were performed on
   up-regulated profile 7 and down-regulated profile 2, which exhibited
   the same patterns. In the two profiles, metabolic process and cellular
   process, binding and catalytic activity, and cell part and cell were
   the most abundant subcategories in biological process, molecular
   function, and cellular component, respectively. The genes clustered
   into the same GO terms in MBI8255 and CCRI36 showed opposite patterns,
   and there were more enriched genes of CCRI36 over those of MBI8255 in
   profile 7 while presenting less enriched genes of CCRI36 than those of
   MBI8255 in profile 2. Based on the KEGG results, only two pathways,
   namely, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal
   transduction, in the two profiles or in the two lines, were
   significantly enriched, and more genes were clustered in CCRI36 than in
   MBI8255 in the up-regulated expression pattern (profile 7), while more
   genes were down-regulated in MBI8255 than in CCRI36 (profile 2). The
   consistency between the GO and KEGG results might be due to the diverse
   strategies adopted in response to V991 infection by the different
   resistant or susceptible lines. With regards to the enriched metabolic
   processes in our results, secondary metabolism pathways were found to
   play particularly significant roles in response to V991 infection and
   they have been reported to participate in the abiotic stress response
   [[193]73]. Furthermore, phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis
   pathways have also been suggested to accumulate in response to pathogen
   infection, as indicated in a previous study [[194]74].

The phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway in response to V991 infection

   The phenylpropanoid pathway in plants has been reported to participate
   in some abiotic stress responses, such as drought, salinity, and
   pathogen infection, and it serves as the main metabolic pathway for
   lignin biosynthesis [[195]75]. As a major cell wall component, lignin
   acts as a main plant mechanical support structure and defense system in
   response to pathogen infection [[196]76], the synthesis of which is
   subjected to the oxidative coupling of p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl
   (G), and syringyl (S) monolignols. In this study, the majority of the
   key enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway were analyzed based on the
   combined RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR results. Diverse expression patterns were
   observed in response to V991 infection, mostly presented by the
   up-regulation of lignin biosynthesis-related enzymes rather than
   flavonoid synthesis-related enzymes, which might result from the
   antagonistic relationships between the two synthesis pathways.
   Nevertheless, our findings still indicate the positive effect of V991
   infection on the phenylpropanoid pathway in CCRI36 and MBI8255, further
   promoting lignin biosynthesis.

   During the synthesis pathways of G and S type lignins, most genes
   showed up-regulated expression patterns, including C3H, CCR, and CAD,
   while only one down-regulated gene, COMT, was identified, which
   represented the difficult shift from caffeic acid to ferulic acid
   during the synthesis of S and G type lignins. Furthermore, the
   up-regulated CCoAOMT, which transforms caffeoyl CoA to feruloyl CoA,
   might be efficiently utilized to obtain adequate lignin, as has been
   reported in switchgrass and duckweed [[197]77, [198]78]. In general,
   the lignin biosynthesis pathway stimulated by V991 infection would
   produce a higher lignin content, which could combine with some other
   antioxidants to participate in the regulation of ROS production in the
   apoplast [[199]76]. These results revealed the significant role of the
   phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway in response to V991 infection.

Oxidation-reduction processes in response to V991 infection

   In response to abiotic stress, ROS generation in plants can be
   activated by ROS-producing genes, resulting in oxidative stress and
   accordingly giving rise to ROS-scavenging pathways in order to maintain
   the ROS homeostatic balance. In the present study, a total of 1433 DEGs
   were found to participate in oxidation-reduction processes, derived
   from the GO analysis results of all the DEGs. RBOHs, identified as
   RbohB, RbohD, and RbohF in our study, have been reported to participate
   in the process of ROS production [[200]52] and mostly showed
   up-regulated patterns from 0 DAI to 2 DAI, which indicated increased
   oxidative stress in response to V991 infection.

   In order to eliminate the generated ROS, plants have evolved ROS
   scavenging pathways in response to damage caused to the cellular
   components by high oxidative stress. Among the antioxidant enzymes,
   SOD, as the first line of antioxidant defense, is responsible for
   transforming O[2]^− into H[2]O[2], and subsequently APX and CAT further
   transform H[2]O[2] into H[2]O with their corresponding compounds
   [[201]79]. Under V991 infection, only two SOD genes showed up-regulated
   expression patterns in CCRI36, but presented down-regulation after
   up-regulation in MBI8255, which was consistent with the SOD results of
   the biochemical tests, indicating the significant roles of the two
   enzymes in ROS scavenging pathways. APX or CAT were mainly
   down-regulated in CCRI36, but were up-regulated following the
   down-regulation in MBI8255. Similar results were observed with regards
   to the activity changes of MDAR, GPXs, and PreR. In the two lines, in
   addition to the up-regulation and then down-regulation of AOX enzymes,
   ferritin and Trx were continuously up-regulated, which suggested their
   positive participation in ROS scavenging pathways. Therefore, under V.
   dahliae infection, ROS generation increased in both CCRI36 and MBI8255,
   subsequently leading to the activation of ROS scavenging pathways to
   protect the plants. In contrast, the resistant line exhibited
   relatively higher ROS scavenging-related enzyme activity than the
   susceptible line, which might be due to the resistant line possessing a
   relatively well-developed ROS scavenging system.

Plant resistance in response to V991 infection

   The process of pathogen infection starts from an influx of calcium and
   an oxidative burst triggered by PAMPs, and subsequently activates not
   only the MAPK pathway and calcium-dependent protein kinase, but also
   stomatal closure and transcriptional reprogramming, ultimately
   resulting in SA accumulation and callose deposition [[202]79–[203]81].
   In order to respond to the invasions from various pathogens, plants
   have evolved two main defense mechanisms. Along with the recognition of
   PAMPs occurring on the extracellular surface of the host cell, PPRs
   together with their stimulation activate a basal immune response,
   namely, PTI [[204]27, [205]28]. Upon successful pathogen invasion, the
   generated effectors are first delivered into the host cells, further
   suppressing the PTI, which can be recognized by specific R genes. ETI,
   the second-type immune reaction, is activated by the production of R
   genes. The induction of plant resistance to pathogens and HR are
   ultimately triggered following the special recognition of both PRRs and
   R genes [[206]30, [207]31].

   In the present study, the interactions of two lines, MBI8255, resistant
   to VW, and CCRI36, susceptible to VW, with V. dahliae were investigated
   with the aim of revealing the molecular mechanisms of the plant immune
   response to plant pathogens. Based on the results of GO enrichment
   analysis of all of the DEGs, a total of 158 immunity-related genes with
   A. thaliana annotations were clustered into the defense response GO
   term (GO: 0006952), and significantly different expression patterns
   were observed between the resistant and susceptible lines. Among the
   resistance genes, R genes were mostly identified from the results and
   could be classified into TIR-NBS-LRR and CC-NBS-LRR genes based on the
   different N-terminal domains [[208]35, [209]36]. As numerous genes were
   annotated as R genes, only those with high-level expression were
   further investigated, although more genes encoding the second-type R
   domain were observed. With regards to the first-type R genes,
   up-regulated expression patterns were identified in the two highly
   expressed genes, Gh_D05G0053 and Gh_D05G3603, with the former showing
   higher expression in MBI8255 than in CCRI36, except at 0 DAI, while the
   latter presented no significant difference between the expression
   levels of the two lines at the same stage. There were more than twice
   as many second-type R genes than first-type R genes, and five
   high-expression genes were found, namely, Gh_D05G3603, Gh_A10G2076,
   Gh_A09G2289, Gh_D03G1355, and Gh_A11G2680. The first four of these
   genes showed up-regulation from 0 DAI to 1 DAI, while the latter one
   was continuously down-regulated during the preliminary stages of V991
   infection, and, interestingly, was highly expressed at 0 DAI in the
   resistant line. In addition, there were 22 genes encoding LRR and
   NB-ARC domain-containing disease resistance proteins in this term, and
   the two high-level expressed genes, Gh_D03G1527 and Gh_D05G2688, showed
   the opposite expression patterns, with the former being first
   down-regulated and then up-regulated, while the latter was
   down-regulated following up-regulation in the two lines. Over 40 genes
   encoding NB-ARC domain-containing disease resistance proteins were
   identified, while only the relatively highly expressed Gh_D11G3200 was
   first up-regulated and then down-regulated in the two lines.

   In addition to the above-mentioned R-related genes, there were many
   other resistance genes involved in PTI and ETI. Two genes annotated as
   ADR1-like 1, namely, Gh_A05G1718 and Gh_D01G1013, were relatively
   highly expressed, with the former showing continuous up-regulation in
   the two lines, while the latter was down-regulated in CCRI36 and
   up-regulated following down-regulation in MBI8255. In the two lines,
   one MOS2 gene (Gh_A05G2156) was persistently down-regulated, while two
   ZED1 genes, Gh_A12G0580 and Gh_D12G0592, were up-regulated. Four
   MLP-like genes with high-level expression, Gh_D02G1410, Gh_D02G1446,
   Gh_D07G2407, and Gh_D02G0560, were investigated, with the former two
   being up-regulated in CCRI36 and first up-regulated and then
   down-regulated in MBI8255, while the latter two showed up-regulation
   following down-regulation in the two lines. Both pathogenesis-related 4
   (Gh_D11G2592) and PYR1-like 2 (Gh_A04G0244) were up-regulated in the
   two lines, and the same pattern was observed in the three genes
   encoding P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases
   superfamily proteins (Gh_A12G1852, Gh_A12G1867, and Gh_D12G2022) in
   CCRI36, with opposite expressions observed between the former and the
   latter two. The RPS5-like 1 gene, Gh_A11G2559, was up-regulated in
   CCRI36, but was first up-regulated and then down-regulated in MBI8255,
   as observed in one highly expressed MLO gene, Gh_D06G2377. The same
   expression patterns were identified between other high-level MLO genes
   (Gh_D02G0670) and TAO1 (Gh_D06G2323), which showed up-regulation
   following down-regulation in the two lines. Interestingly, higher-level
   expression was observed in the resistant lines over those in the
   susceptible line at 0 and 1 DAI, although diverse expression patterns
   were identified in the above immunity-related genes, which suggested
   that the greater resistance to VW might result from the better defense
   mechanisms in cotton.

Conclusion

   In this study, artificial greenhouse, natural field, and disease
   nursery tests were conducted to confirm the selected CSSL (MBI8255) and
   its recurrent parent (CCRI36) together with two controls (Zhongzhimian2
   and Jimian11), resulting in VW-resistant MBI8255 and VW-susceptible
   CCRI36. Subsequently, the two lines were separately subjected to
   biochemical tests and RNA-Seq, using root samples collected during the
   preliminary stages of V991 infection (0, 1, and 2 DAI). In terms of the
   biochemical tests, the activities of POD and PPO were positively
   correlated with VW resistance, while a negative correlation was
   detected between MDA content and VW resistance. Additionally, a total
   of 77,412 genes, including 6934 novel genes, were identified in our
   RNA-Seq data, further leading to the identification of 23,180 DEGs
   through multiple comparisons. Following gene temporal expression
   pattern analysis, two identical profiles (P-value ≤0.05) derived from
   the DEGs of the two lines were further investigated by GO and KEGG
   enrichment analysis, which mostly clustered into metabolic process and
   cellular process in biological process, binding and catalytic activity
   in molecular function, and cell part and cell in cellular component,
   while significantly participating in the pathways of phenylpropanoid
   biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction. Finally, expression
   profiling of the DEGs related to the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway,
   oxidation-reduction process, and plant resistance was carried out to
   identify the key candidate genes or pathways, which provided an
   abundance of information for revealing the mechanisms of VW resistance.
   The results of this study facilitate further research into cotton VW
   resistance by not only providing resistant material for cotton
   breeding, but also by improving our understanding of the mechanisms of
   VW resistance.

Methods

Preparation of V. dahliae and plant material

   The V. dahliae fungus isolate used in this study was the highly
   aggressive defoliating V991. V991 was first cultured on solid potato
   dextrose agar (PDA) medium for 7 d at 25 °C and then transferred to
   Czapek liquid medium to obtain conidia, after which it was placed in an
   incubated shaker (Haerbin Donglian Electonics, China) with a shaking
   speed of 150 rpm/min in darkness for 7–14 d at 25 °C. The concentration
   of the spore suspension was diluted to about 1 × 10^7 spores/mL with
   sterile water for the root inoculation, which was assessed using a
   hemocytometer [[210]6, [211]16].

   The CSSLs constructed by our lab were derived from the hybridization
   between CCRI36 and Hai 1 in 2003 at the Institute of Cotton Research of
   the Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences (CRICAAS; Anyang, Henan
   province, China), in which the population was successfully developed
   through multiple generations of backcrossing and selfing, as described
   elsewhere [[212]82]. CCRI36 developed by CRICAAS is a G. hirsutum
   cultivar with wide planting areas and high-yield fiber products, while
   Hai 1 stored by CRICAAS is a G. barbadense cultivar with excellent
   fiber quality and high resistance to Verticillium wilt [[213]24]. Based
   on VW resistance investigations in multiple locations for years,
   MBI8255 and CCRI36 were found to be stably resistant and susceptible to
   VW, respectively. Two controls, Zhongzhimian2 and Jimain11, were
   selected as VW-resistant and VW-susceptible controls during the
   subsequent greenhouse and field tests.

Greenhouse tests

   MBI8255 and CCRI36 together with the two controls (Zhongzhimian2 and
   Jimian11) were selected for the VW resistance tests in an artificial
   greenhouse located at the Institute of Cotton Research, Chinese Academy
   of Agricultural Sciences (ICR-CAAS). After disinfecting with 75%
   ethanol for 30 s and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite for 10 min, the seeds
   were washed with sterile water 3–5 times and then subsequently placed
   into paper cups filled with sterilized sand and vermiculite in a
   proportion of 4:6. There were 7–10 seeds that were planted in each cup
   for germination, and 5 seedlings per cup that exhibited good and
   synchronous growth were reserved for further V. dahliae infection.
   Three replications were performed: (1) five paper cups from March 28,
   2015 to May 30, 2015; (2) seven paper cups from August 26, 2015 to
   October 28, 2015; and (3) 10 paper cups from August 28, 2015 to October
   30, 2015. When the first true leaf was open and flat, each paper cup
   was placed in a paper tray, the bottom of which had been removed with
   scissors, together with 10 mL of 1 × 10^7 spores/mL conidial
   suspension.

   Phenotypic identification of VW resistance was separately carried out
   at 15 and 30 DAI, and each seedling was evaluated according to a
   severity rating system (from 0 to 4) based on the disease symptoms of
   the plant leaves [[214]83]. Specifically, 0 indicates healthy plant
   without disease symptom; 1 indicates less than 25% leaves with disease
   symptoms; 2 indicates 25–50% leaves with disease symptoms; 3 indicates
   50–75% leaves with disease symptoms; and 4 indicates over 75% leaves
   with disease symptoms and even completely defoliated or dead plants.
   The DI was adopted to calculate the VW resistance using the following
   formula:
   [MATH: <mi>DI</mi><mo>=</mo><mfenced close="]"
   open="["><mrow><mo>∑</mo><mfenced close=")"
   open="("><mrow><mi>Ni</mi><mo>×</mo><mi

   mathvariant="normal">N</mi><mo>×</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow></mfenced></mrow>
   </mfenced><mo>×</mo><mn>100</mn> :MATH]

   where i is the disease grade from 0 to 4, Ni is the number of plants
   with the corresponding disease grade, and N is the number of total
   plants investigated for each material.

Natural field and disease nursery tests

   The natural field investigations of MBI8255, CCRI36, and the two
   controls were conducted on two different experimental farms: one
   replication in Anyang (Henan Province) and one replication in Shihezi
   (Xinjiang Province). Under natural conditions, the materials planted in
   the field for VW resistance investigations were infected with a mixture
   of V. dahliae isolates. The phenotypic identification of VW resistance
   was performed at the flowering and maturity stage in 2015, and DI was
   calculated using the above-mentioned formula.

   With the help of Professor Cai Yingfan, the disease nursery tests of
   MBI8255, CCRI36, and Jimian11 were conducted by the State Key
   Laboratory of Cotton Biology, Henan Key Laboratory of Plant Stress
   Biology, School of Life Science, Henan University. The phenotypic data
   were collected at the maturity stage in 2015, and DI was calculated
   using the formula described above.

Sample collection

   Based on the VW-resistance results of the artificial greenhouse,
   natural field, and disease nursery tests, MBI8255 and CCRI36 were
   separately selected as the VW-resistant and VW-susceptible lines for
   further RNA-Seq and biochemical tests. The sterilized seeds were
   planted in three plastic trays filled with sterilized sand and
   vermiculite (4:6) and placed in a constant temperature incubator, with
   three biological replications. The culture conditions were set as
   follows: 25 °C, 60–70% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of
   14 h/10 h (day/night). When the first true leaf was open and flat, the
   seedlings were removed from the plastic trays and inoculated via
   root-dipping into either the 1 × 10^7 spores/mL conidia suspension or
   sterile water (for mock inoculation). After inoculation for 60 s, the
   seedlings were transferred back to the plastic trays in the constant
   temperature incubator. The root samples were harvested at 0, 1, and 2
   DAI, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at − 80 °C, and divided
   into two portions: one for RNA-Seq with three replications and another
   for the biochemical tests with three replications.

Biochemical tests

   Protective enzymes relevant to VW resistance were selected to
   investigate the activity changes during the preliminary stages of V991
   infection (0, 1, and 2 DAI), including CAT, SOD, and POD. Fresh roots
   (0.1 g) per sample were ground in liquid nitrogen and suspended in
   0.9 mL phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) or saline solution. The 10% tissue
   homogenate of the CAT samples was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min,
   while those of the POD and SOD samples were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for
   15 min. The obtained supernatants were collected to determine the
   activities of CAT, POD, and SOD using commercially available kits from
   the Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China), and
   were separately measured using a spectrophotometer at 405, 420, and
   550 nm.

   The defensive enzymes relevant to VW resistance, namely, PAL and PPO,
   were subjected to activity tests at 0, 1, and 2 DAI. Fresh roots
   (0.1 g) per sample were ground in liquid nitrogen and subsequently
   suspended in 0.9 mL extracting solution on ice. The tissue homogenate
   of the PAL sample was centrifuged at 4 °C and 10,000 rpm for 10 min,
   while the PPO sample was centrifuged at 4 °C at 8000 rpm for 10 min.
   The obtained supernatants were further processed according to the
   instructions of the PAL and POD assay kits from the Nanjing Jiancheng
   Bioengineering Institute and were measured spectrophotometrically at
   209 and 525 nm.

   Biochemical substances relevant to VW resistance, such as MDA, soluble
   sugar, soluble protein, and proline, were selected to assess the
   content changes during the V991 infection process. Fresh roots (0.1 g)
   were ground in liquid nitrogen and then suspended in 0.9 mL solution of
   phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) or saline for the MDA, soluble protein, and
   proline determinations. The homogenate of the MDA samples was
   centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min, while that of the soluble protein
   and proline samples were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min. With
   regards to the content of soluble sugar, 0.1–0.2 g fresh roots were
   ground with 1 mL distilled water and then cultured in a boiling water
   bath for 10 min. After cooling, the tissue homogenate of the soluble
   sugar was centrifuged at room temperature at 8000 rpm for 10 min. The
   collected supernatants were further used for the content tests
   according to the instructions of the MDA, soluble sugar, soluble
   protein, and proline assay kits from the Nanjing Jiancheng
   Bioengineering Institute, and were separately measured
   spectrophotometrically at 532, 620, 595, and 520 nm. Three biological
   replications per sample were performed.

RNA extraction, library construction, and transcriptome sequencing

   According to the instruction manual of the RNAprep Pure Plant Kit
   (Tiangen, Beijing, China), the total RNA per sample was extracted from
   the frozen roots. The extracted RNA was first subjected to degradation
   and contamination detection by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and
   integrity assessment by the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer
   2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA), subsequently being
   calibrated by the Qubit® RNA Assay Kit in a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer
   (Life Technologies, CA, USA). High-quality RNA (3 μg) per sample was
   required for cDNA library construction following the manufacturer’s
   recommendations of NEBNext® Ultra™ RNA Library rep Kit for Illumina®
   (NEB, USA), and index codes were added to attribute the sequences to
   each sample. After being purified from total RNA by poly-T
   oligo-attached magnetic beads, mRNA was fragmented into 150–200 nt RNA
   inserts, which were used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA by random
   hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H^−) and the
   second-strand cDNA by DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. End-repair and
   adaptor ligation were performed on the double-stranded cDNA. The
   suitable fragments were purified with an AMPure XP system (Beckman
   Coulter, Beverly, USA) and enriched by PCR amplification. Subsequently,
   PCR products were purified using the AMPure XP system and assessment of
   library quality was performed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system.
   For cluster generation, a cBot Cluster Generation System was used for
   clustering of the index-coded samples by the TruSeq Cluster Kit
   v3-cBot-HS (Illumina). In total, 18 cDNA libraries constructed from 18
   RNA-Seq samples (two cotton lines at 0, 1, and 2 DAI with three
   replications) and were sequenced on a flow cell with an Illumina HiSeq™
   2500 sequencing platform.

Data quality control and read mapping to the reference genome

   The raw data in FASTQ format were first processed through in-house Perl
   scripts, resulting in read sequences and their corresponding base
   qualities. The clean data were obtained by filtering adapters and
   low-quality reads with poly-N > 10% or Q20 < 20% according to the
   Illumina pipeline, and the Q30 and GC content were subsequently
   calculated.

   The high-quality clean reads were mapped to G. hirsutum as the
   reference genome [40] together with gene model annotation files, which
   were downloaded from the CottonGen database
   ([215]http://www.cottongen.org). The index of the G. hirsutum genome
   was built by Bowtie v2.2.3 and the paired-end clean reads were aligned
   to the reference genome (G. hirsutum) using TopHat v2.0.12 [[216]84].

DEG analysis

   In order to quantify the gene expression levels, the read numbers
   mapped to each gene were counted by HTSeq v0.6.1, and then the FPKM
   value was employed to calculate the expression level of each gene based
   on the length of the gene and the read counts mapped to this gene. As
   the most commonly utilized method for estimating gene expression levels
   at present, FPKM considers the effect of sequencing depth and gene
   length for the read counts at the same time [[217]70].

   The DESeq R package (v1.18.0) was used to identify differential gene
   expression between the control and treatment, which provided
   statistical routines for identifying the differential expression in the
   digital gene expression data using a model based on the negative
   binomial distribution. To manage the FDR, Benjamini and Hochberg’s
   approach was performed to adjust the obtained P-values. DEGs were set
   as those genes with an adjusted P-value ≤0.01 as determined by DESeq.

   GO enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed by the GOseq R package
   with a corrected P-value ≤0.5 as the cutoff. KOBAS software was used to
   test the statistical enrichment of the DEGs in the KEGG pathways.

Comparison of the expression patterns of the DEGs

   STEM software (Carnegie Mellon University, USA) was used to identify
   the temporal expression patterns of the DEGs in response to V991
   infection (0, 1, and 2 DAI). GO and KEGG enrichment analysis was also
   employed to identify the potential functional genes or to characterize
   the expression profiles identified by STEM analysis.

Validation of RNA-Seq by qRT-PCR

   In order to verify the reliability of the transcriptome data, qRT-PCR
   was performed on 20 randomly selected DEGs with three biological and
   technical replicates for each sample. The Primer-BLAST online tool of
   NCBI was used to design the specific primers of the selected DEGs. The
   cDNAs were synthesized using a TranScript All-in-One First-Strand cDNA
   Synthesis SuperMix for qPCR Kit (Transgen Biotech, Beijing, China).
   qRT-PCR was performed following the protocol of TransStart Top Green
   qPCR SuperMix kit (Transgen Biotech, Beijing, China) on the ABI 7500
   fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The β-Actin
   housekeeping gene was used as the reference to normalize the relative
   expression levels, with the following primer sequences: F:
   5’-ATCCTCCGTCTTGACCTTG-3′ and R: 5’-TGTCCGTCAGGCAACTCAT-3′. The qRT-PCR
   carried out in a 20 μL system at the following conditions: one cycle of
   94 °C for 30s; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 34 s, and one
   cycle of 60 °C for 60s. The relative gene expression level was
   quantified using the 2^-ΔΔCt method [[218]85].
