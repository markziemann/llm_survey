Here’s a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis methods used in the provided scientific article, based on the information available within the text. The answers will be formatted for a table as requested.

**1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**

Not described. The article does *not* explicitly state which tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis.

**2. Was a tool version number provided?**

Not described. Since the tool itself isn't mentioned, a version number isn't provided either.

**3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**

KEGG. The article specifically mentions “KEGG pathway enrichment analysis” multiple times, indicating this was the gene set library used.

**4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**

Not described. The article doesn’t mention whether a background gene list (or universe) was defined for the enrichment analysis.

**5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**

Not described. The statistical test used for determining significance in the enrichment analysis isn't stated in the article.

**6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**

Yes. The article states: “...pathway enrichment analysis was performed with false discovery rate (FDR) correction…”
