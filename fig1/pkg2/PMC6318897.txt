Abstract

Background

   The Tibetan highland fish, Gymnocypris przewalskii, migrates from Lake
   Qinghai to its spawning grounds every summer. This seasonal
   reproduction is critically regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic
   signals. However, the molecular mechanisms that process environmental
   oscillations to initiate the seasonal mating are largely unknown.

Results

   A transcriptomic analysis was conducted on the brain and gonad of male
   and female G. przewalskii in reproductive and nonreproductive seasons.
   We obtained 2034, 760, 1158 and 17,856 differentially expressed genes
   between the reproductively active and dormant female brain, male brain,
   ovary and testis. Among these genes, DIO2 was upregulated in the
   reproductively active brain and gonad of both males and females.
   Neuroactive ligand-receptor genes were activated in male and female
   brain. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that retinol metabolism
   was uniquely stimulated in reproductively active males. Genes involved
   in GnRH signaling and sex hormone synthesis exhibited higher expression
   levels in brain and gonad during the reproductive season. A
   co-expression network classified all the genes into 9 modules. The
   network pinpointed CDC42 as the hub gene that connected the pathways in
   responsible for modulating reproduction in G. przewalskii. Meanwhile,
   the sex pheromone receptor gene prostaglandin receptor was identified
   to link to multiple endocrine receptors, such as GnRHR2 in the network.

Conclusions

   The current study profiled transcriptomic variations between
   reproductively active and dormant fish, highlighting the potential
   regulatory mechanisms of seasonal reproduction in G. przewalskii. Our
   data suggested that the seasonal regulation of reproduction in G.
   przewalskii was controlled by the external stimulation of photoperiodic
   variations. The activated transcription of neuroendocrine and sex
   hormone synthesis genes contributed to seasonal reproduction regulation
   in G. przewalskii, which was presumably influenced by the increased
   day-length during the breeding season.

Background

   Seasonal reproduction is an evolutionary adaptive strategy for animals
   living in areas with evident seasonality [[36]1–[37]3]. To maximize the
   survival of offspring, animals in the mid and high latitudes reproduce
   at the most beneficial time of the year, which has moderate climate and
   sufficient food [[38]2]. In vertebrates, the timing of mating behavior
   is tightly controlled by the coordination of both environmental cues
   and internal factors. Seasonal changes in temperature, food
   availability, and day-length are environmental factors required to
   initiate reproduction in many animals [[39]4, [40]5]. Based on the
   relative day-length during the reproductive season, animals are
   classified into long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) breeders [[41]2]. The
   light information received by the retina of mammals and extra retina
   tissues of lower vertebrates influences neuroendocrine production,
   transmitting environmental information to affect the physiological
   activities of animals, including reproduction [[42]6]. For LD breeders,
   increased day length induces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
   production, which facilitates follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and
   luteinizing hormone (LH) synthesis as well as gonad development [[43]7,
   [44]8]. The mechanisms controlling seasonal reproduction have been
   firmly established in mammals, which involve the stimulation of gonad
   development via the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis depending
   on the seasonal fluctuation of melatonin production due to the
   day-length change [[45]9].

   Seasonal reproduction is widely observed in temperate fish species as
   well [[46]10]. For example, medaka is characterized as a LD breeder
   that develops gonads from spring to summer, while salmonid fishes are
   SD breeders who migrate back to home rivers for spawning in autumn
   [[47]11, [48]12]. Although seasonal reproduction is pervasive in fish,
   its molecular basis remains ambiguous. Saccus vasculosus (SV), a
   specific organ in fish brain that serves as a sensor responding to
   photoperiodicity, expresses all the components in the regulation of the
   photoperiodic signaling pathway [[49]13, [50]14]. Meanwhile, a variety
   of neurotransmitters, such as melatonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA,
   and Kiss1, as well as their receptors, have been reported to translate
   environmental stimuli into internal signals and synchronize
   reproduction in different fish species [[51]10, [52]15–[53]17].
   Therefore, seasonal reproduction is likely to be controlled by multiple
   neuroendocrine molecules in fishes in response to photoperiodicity,
   with regulatory mechanisms distinct from those of mammals.

   Gymnocypris przewalskii (subfamily Schizothoracinae) is an endemic fish
   species living in Lake Qinghai in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the largest
   saline and alkaline lake of China [[54]18, [55]19]. Sexually mature G.
   przewalskii (over 3 years old) migrate to spawning rivers in late
   spring and summer (from May to August, the reproductive season, RS) and
   inhabit in the lake in early fall and winter (from September to April,
   the nonreproductive season, NRS). Since the water temperature
   fluctuates dramatically [[56]20, [57]21], day-length is assumed to be
   the reliable environmental stimulus initiating courtship behavior in
   Tibetan highland fish (Fig. [58]1).

   water temperature was measured about 0–0.7 m beneath the water surface
   of the Lake Qinghai. No data on water temperature was available in Jan
   and Feb due to the icing in the winter of the Lake Qinghai. The light
   hours reach the peak in May, and keep as the long day during from May
   to Aug. The decrease in light hours from Jun to Aug is primarily due to
   the rainy season in the summer. The environmental and ecological data
   collected from 1988 to 2004 [[63]20]

   In the current study, we attempted to examine the role of the
   transcriptional regulation in controlling seasonal reproduction in G.
   przewalskii. To achieve this goal, brain and gonad samples from both
   male and female G. przewalskii were collected in the RS and NRS. Gene
   expression analysis revealed that the number of differentially
   expressed genes (DEGs) was 2034 in female brain, 760 in male brain,
   1158 in ovary and 17,856 in testis genes between fishes in RS and NRS.
   DEGs were enriched in pathways including steroid hormone synthesis,
   neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and retinol metabolism. Gene
   co-expression network analysis revealed CDC42 as a hub bridging genes
   in reproduction-related pathways. Taken together, our results showed
   that the timing of breeding in G. przewalskii was highly likely to be
   controlled by the increased day length in the summer, which probably
   induced the transcription of genes in neuroendocrine regulation of sex
   hormone synthesis.

De novo assembly and annotation of G. przewalskii transcriptome

   To identify genes that may be involved in the reproductive migration of
   G. przewalskii, we performed transcriptomic sequencing of brain and
   gonad from 3 male and 3 female G. przewalskii collected in the RS and
   NRS. In total, 1,291,024,718 raw reads were generated from 24
   libraries, which yielded 1,258,421,646 clean reads after the quality
   control procedure. The RNA-seq results were deposited in NCBI Sequence
   Read Archive (SRA) (SRP136464). The de novo assembled transcriptome
   included 122,750 unigenes with N50 of 1593 bp and an average length of
   857 bp (Table [64]1). The reference transcriptome of G. przewalskii
   unigenes was annotated by 4 public databases, Nr, KOG/COG, Swiss-Prot,
   and KEGG. The results showed that 14.40% of unigenes were annotated by
   all databases, and 38.62% of unigenes were annotated by at least one
   database (Fig. [65]2a and Table [66]2). The Non redundant (NR)
   annotation demonstrated that 71% of unigenes were annotated by genes of
   3 fish species (S.rhinocerous, S. anshuiensis, and S. grahami) in
   Sinocyclocheilus, the taxonomically closest fish species to
   Schizothoracinae (Fig. [67]2b). More than half of the annotated
   unigenes had E-values less than 1e-150, suggesting high sequence
   similarity between G. przewalskii and Sinocyclocheilus genomes (Fig.
   [68]2c). Functional annotation by KOG database indicated that 52,285 G.
   przewalskii unigenes were classified into 26 groups, with 11,862
   unigenes involved in signal transduction mechanisms (Fig. [69]2d and
   Additional file [70]1: Table S2). KEGG annotation also showed that 3239
   unigenes were mapped to 30 pathways related to environmental
   information processing, which were likely to regulate the timing of
   seasonal reproduction (Additional file [71]2: Table S3). The assembly
   and annotation of G. przewalskii reference transcriptome laid a solid
   basis for identifying genes involved in the control of seasonal
   reproduction.

Quantification of transcriptional abundance between RS and NRS samples

   Using an adjusted p-value less than 0.05 and an absolute fold change
   greater than 2 as the threshold, 2034, 760, 1158 and 17,856
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were discovered in female brain,
   male brain, ovary and testis of G. przewalskii between RS and NRS
   (Table [76]3). Interestingly, many more DEGs were found in testis than
   in other tissues, implying the significance of gene expression
   regulation in male gonad development. Surprisingly, we found a few DEGs
   that overlapped between male and female in both brain (7.63%, 198 DEGs)
   and gonad (2.77%, 512 DEGs), and 16 DEGs were shared by all 4
   comparisons (Fig. [77]3a and Additional files [78]3, [79]4, [80]5 and
   [81]6: Tables S4-S7). Among these 16 common DEGs, 14 genes were
   upregulated in the reproductively active samples, including type II
   iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO2, Unigene0058594). For the 518 DEGs
   common to male and female gonads, a heatmap clearly displayed obvious
   differences among the 4 groups (Fig. [82]3b). In brain, the signatures
   of 198 shared DEGs clearly separated NRS and RS samples (Fig. [83]3c).
   Meanwhile, we found that these shared DEGs showed gender-dependent
   transcription patterns in RS but not in NRS, suggesting gender-specific
   regulation of reproduction in G. przewalskii (Fig. [84]3c). Moreover,
   male and female RS fish showed distinct expression patterns, suggesting
   that seasonal reproduction was probably controlled by different genes
   in male and female G. przewalskii. To validate the DEGs obtained from
   RNA-seq, the fold changes in 11 unigenes were measured using RT-qPCR,
   and the high correlation coefficient of 0.723 between the two methods
   indicated the accuracy and reliability of the RNA-seq results (Fig.
   [85]3c).

Functional enrichment analyses of DEGs

   To understand the functional consequences of expression variations,
   DEGs of male and female fish were mapped to KEGG pathways. The
   significantly enriched pathways were listed in Fig. [89]4a. Notably,
   GnRH signaling pathway and steroid hormone biosynthesis were identified
   as significant pathways in brain and gonad, respectively, indicating
   the orchestrated expression of genes in brain and gonad in controlling
   seasonal reproduction in G. przewalskii. In GnRH signaling pathway, the
   expression of GnRH2 (Unigene0047142) and LHβ (Unigene0104459) was
   significantly promoted in male and female brain (Fig. [90]3b). In the
   steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway, testosterone 17-β-dehydrogenase 3
   (HSD17B3, Unigene0005059) and estradiol 17-β-dehydrogenase 1 (HSD17B1,
   Unigene0063161), key enzymes in the synthesis of testosterone and
   estradiol, showed enhanced expression levels in reproductively active
   fish gonads (Fig. [91]3b). Retinol metabolism was enriched in male
   brain and gonad, suggesting its essential role in regulating
   reproduction in males. Retinol metabolism contained 7 DEGs, including
   the activation of 3 genes in reproductively active male brain and 4
   genes in RS testis (Fig. [92]4b). Additionally, neuroactive
   ligand-receptor genes exhibited gender- and tissue-specific activation
   patterns. For instance, KISS1 receptor gene (Kiss1r, Unigene0009160)
   was stimulated in RS male brain, and the expression of LH receptor
   (LHR, Unigene0086623) was increased in reproductively active gonads in
   both male and female individuals (Fig. [93]3b). In particular, we found
   that the mRNA levels of neuropeptide Y receptor (NPYR, Unigene0080609),
   acetylcholine receptor 9 (nAChR9, Unigene0041188), relaxin receptor 2
   (RXFP2, Unigene0021440), galanin receptor 2 (GALR2, Unigene0054699) and
   oxytocin receptor (OXTR, Unigene49178) were exclusively induced in RS
   female brain, suggesting their roles in the seasonal reproduction in
   female individuals (Fig. [94]4c). Not surprisingly, genes in metabolic
   and immune pathways were differentially expressed between fish in the
   RS and NRS. This result was highly likely to be related to the
   physiological and behavioral changes in G. przewalskii during its
   reproductive migration from the salt lake to the freshwater river.

Identification of a seasonal-reproduction-related coexpression network

   With the goal of figuring out the networks involved in the mating
   regulation of G. przewalskii, weighted gene coexpression network
   analysis (WGCNA), a technique based on pairwise correlations between
   gene expression trends across all samples, was employed. Based on the
   expression values, we ultimately obtained 9 modules, and the genes
   within each module were highly interconnected according to their
   transcriptional levels (Fig. [97]5a). Genes in 9 modules showed
   distinct expression patterns across all the samples, among which pink
   and darkgreen as well as black and royalblue modules exhibited higher
   gene expression in RS and NRS male gonad (Additional file [98]7: Figure
   S1). According to the correlation coefficients between the module and
   the group, we found darkgreen and royalblue modules showed highest and
   significant correlation to RS and NRS male gonad (Fig. [99]5a and
   Additional file [100]8: Table S9). Therefore, we performed the KEGG
   enrichment analysis on genes in the two modules. In the royalblue
   module, 192 genes were enriched in pathways related to energy
   metabolism, presumably because of fasting during the spawning migration
   (Fig. [101]5b). In the darkgreen module, 2291 genes were classified
   into 14 significantly enriched pathways. We defined the darkgreen
   module as “endocrine system” since a large number of pathways played
   crucial functions in reproductive endocrinology (Fig. [102]5b). The
   coexpression network in the darkgreen module was further explored.
   After filtering out weak connections with weights less than 0.25, we
   generated a network consisting of 89 genes, including 3 hub genes,
   CDC42 (Unigene0074964, cell division control protein 42), SLC27A6
   (Unigene0008858, long-chain fatty acid transport protein 6) and ACBP
   (Unigene0038759, acyl-CoA binding protein) (Fig. [103]5c and
   Additional file [104]9: Table S8). Among the three hub genes, CDC42
   connected with genes in multiple pathways, including GnRHR2
   (Unigene0054690), PTGFR (prostaglandin F receptor, Unigene0036737), and
   RDH12 (Unigene0050327), suggested the potential cascade regulation of
   the seasonal reproduction in G. przewalskii. The network included
   interactions among known reproduction-related genes, such as the
   connection between BMP7 (Unigene0017986) and FSHR (FSH receptor,
   Unigene0088176). Links among fish pheromone receptor genes, PTGFR,
   PTGER4 (prostaglandin E2 receptor EP4, Unigene0061799) and GnRHR2 were
   depicted, suggesting pheromone had potential effects on the seasonal
   reproduction in G. przewalskii (Fig. [105]5c and Additional file
   [106]8: Table S9). This gene network indicated sophisticated control of
   seasonal reproduction via transcriptional regulation.

Discussion

   Reproduction in most fishes is a seasonal phenomenon that occurs at a
   precise time of the year to ensure the survival of the offspring. The
   timing of the spawning migration is tightly controlled by the
   coordination of internal and external signals. Studies of the genetic
   and physiological bases of reproduction have been carried out in
   several fish species, and the results suggested both universality and
   diversity in the modulation of seasonal breeding [[109]11,
   [110]22–[111]26]. Among environmental cues, photoperiod is considered
   the primary and most reliable determinant of the timing of reproduction
   via neuroendocrine regulation [[112]27, [113]28]. G. przewalskii
   inhabits in a region with evident seasonality. Long-term observations
   have demonstrated that the water temperature in this region shows
   significant fluctuation in the spring and early summer due to the
   sunshine, wind and precipitation. However, the day length peaks from
   May to Aug (Fig. [114]1c) [[115]20, [116]21]. Therefore, we proposed
   that increased day length played the critical role in regulating
   seasonal reproduction in Tibetan highland fish. In the current study,
   we compared reproductively active and dormant G. przewalskii at the
   transcriptomic level, aiming to uncover the regulatory mechanisms that
   synchronize environmental cues and reproduction. The high quality of
   the reference transcriptome laid a foundation for the study of the
   molecular basis of seasonal breeding in G. przewalskii.

Potential interplay between photoperiod and reproduction in G. przewalskii

   Several neuroendocrine molecules were identified in RS brain samples,
   which was the possible outcome of the increased day-length in RS. DIO2,
   the key enzyme in the conversion of thyroid hormone to its bioactive
   form [[117]8, [118]29], is induced by LD exposure in birds and mammals
   during the RS [[119]30, [120]31]. The enhanced transcription of DIO2
   found in reproductively active fishes may result from the increased
   day-length, based on the similar regulatory mechanisms in other
   vertebrates. This result highlights its potential role in facilitating
   seasonal reproduction via photoperiodicity in G. przewalskii.
   Meanwhile, several neuroendocrine receptor genes that have been
   reported to control sexual maturation and reproduction in other species
   were stimulated in G. przewalskii during the RS. For example, massive
   studies have confirmed that Kiss1 and its receptor mediate the
   photoperiodic control and sexual maturation in male fishes and mice via
   promoting GnRH production [[121]32, [122]33]. In reproductively active
   male G. przewalskii, the activation of Kiss1r during the RS may bridge
   the gap from LD sensing to gene expression in GnRH signaling. It has
   been reported that neuroendocrine receptor genes, NPYR, nAChR9, RXFP2,
   GALR2 and OXTR exhibit robust circadian expression patterns and
   regulate HPG axis in many species [[123]34–[124]38]. The activation of
   these genes in female individuals suggests their gender-specific roles
   in regulation of genes in GnRH in G. przewalskii through the increased
   day-length in RS [[125]34–[126]38].

   The function of GnRH in reproduction has been well established in a
   variety of species. GnRH promotes the production of LH and FSH, which
   in turn result in gonad development and breeding behaviors [[127]9,
   [128]39, [129]40]. The simultaneous upregulation of GnRH2 and LHβ in
   brain, as well as that of testosterone 17-β-dehydrogenase 3 and
   estradiol 17-β-dehydrogenase 1 in gonad, highlights the importance of
   the GnRH signaling pathway in the coordination of sexual hormone
   synthesis in G. przewalskii during the RS. Overall, the transcriptomic
   analysis indicated the involvement of photoperiodic and neuroendocrine
   regulation in the seasonal reproduction of G. przewalskii.

   Melatonin is known to control the timing of reproduction by influencing
   GnRH production in many species, including fish [[130]41]. However, we
   did not observe DEGs in melatonin synthesis in the current study,
   indicating that melatonin probably was not engaged in directing
   seasonal reproduction in G. przewalskii. In addition to melatonin,
   dopamine, GABA and NPY were thought to regulate gonadal development in
   fish [[131]10], therefore, we considered that other neuroendocrine
   molecules, such as NPY, acetylcholine, relaxin, galanin and oxytocin,
   contributed to seasonal breeding in G. przewalskii.

Dual functions of retinol metabolism in male G. przewalskii reproductive
regulation

   The functional enrichment analysis indicated that retinol metabolism
   probably exerted an important function in controlling reproduction in
   male G. przewalskii, due to the activation of the pathway in both brain
   and testis during RS. Retinol metabolism involves a series of reactions
   that convert dietary vitamin A to all-trans retinoic acid (RA), the
   cellular active metabolite [[132]42]. First, vitamin A is processed to
   all-trans retinol, which is stored predominantly in the liver. In
   response to the body’s requirements, retinol is secreted from the liver
   and delivered to target tissues, where RA is generated [[133]43]. RA
   binds to its receptors, retinol X receptor α (RXRA) and retinol X
   receptor γ (RXRG), which exert diverse functions depending on the
   tissue and cell types [[134]39, [135]43–[136]45]. Accumulated evidence
   suggests that RA and its receptors control spermatogenesis. RALDH is
   the rate-limiting enzyme for RA biosynthesis [[137]46]. Mice deficient
   in genes encoding RALDH and RA receptors showed phenotypes of low RA
   levels in testis and impaired spermatogenesis, indicating that RA is
   crucial for male reproduction [[138]47, [139]48]. In the current study,
   we observed that genes responsible for RA synthesis were stimulated in
   RS testis, probably causing elevated RA concentration. Given this
   information and the increased transcription of RA receptor genes, it
   was reasonable to speculate that the upregulation of genes in retinol
   metabolism and RA signaling may contribute to the seasonal formation of
   sperm in male G. przewalskii.

   On the other hand, retinol metabolism regulated the seasonal
   reproduction through the deep brain photoreceptors in lower
   vertebrates, by influencing neurogenesis, locomotion, and synaptic
   plasticity [[140]49]. It is well accepted that nonmammalian vertebrates
   detect light via deep brain photoreceptors lying outside the retina
   [[141]50]. Vertebrate ancient (VA) opsin and 11-cis-retinal form the
   photopigments that respond to photoperiodism in the hypothalamus of
   birds [[142]51]. In fish species, all components of the photoperiodic
   transduction machinery are integrated into a brain region called SV,
   where opsin family genes are expressed [[143]2]. The activation of
   genes in retinal synthesis suggests that they probably participate into
   the photoperiodic response by interacting with opsin in male G.
   przewalskii brain.

Molecular network controlling seasonal reproduction in G. przewalskii

   Co-expression network analysis uncovered interactions among the genes
   controlling seasonal reproduction in G. przewalskii. For example, a
   connection between BMP7 and FSHR in G. przewalskii was revealed, in
   accordance with a previous finding showing a direct increase in FSHR
   expression by BMP7 activation in human cell lines [[144]52]. This
   result improved our confidence in the gene interactions in the network
   and indicated the universality in reproductive regulation between fish
   and mammals. In addition, the hub gene CDC42 has been reported to
   modulate reproduction by stimulation of LH synthesis, oocyte meiotic
   maturation and fertilization in mammals [[145]53, [146]54]. We also
   noticed the connections of CDC42 with genes in GnRH signaling, retinol
   metabolism and oocyte maturation in the network, emphasizing its
   importance in coordinating the photoperiodicity, the HPG axis and gonad
   development in G. przewalskii. Moreover, it was worth noting the
   involvement of prostaglandin receptor genes PTGER4 and PTGFR in the
   network, which interacted with PGTR, GnRHR2 and FSHR. Prostaglandins
   are the major water-borne, hormonally derived sex pheromones in fishes.
   They induce reproductive behavior by interacting with receptors
   [[147]23, [148]55]. Our results indicated they were co-regulated in the
   reproductively active male gonad, highlighting the potential feedback
   response in controlling the spawning migration in male population.
   Further works are required to untangle the role of pheromone in
   seasonal breeding of G. przewalskii.

Conclusions

   The current study was the first attempt to investigate the molecular
   regulation of seasonal reproduction in Tibetan highland fish. The
   activation of DIO2 by the LD of the summer may influence sex hormone
   synthesis in G. przewalskii. The upregulation of neuroactive
   ligand-receptor genes was involved in the response to day-length
   change, and these receptors probably switched on genes in GnRH
   signaling and steroid hormone synthesis. Genes in retinol metabolism
   were specifically stimulated in reproductively active brain and testis
   to manage phototransduction and spermatogenesis in male G. przewalskii.
   The network analysis identified CDC42 as a hub due to its interactions
   with genes in multiple pathways. Meanwhile, the interaction among
   prostaglandin receptor genes with GnRHR2 and FSHR suggested the
   potential feedback regulation in courtship behaviors in male G.
   przewalskii. Moreover, the well-designed condition controlled
   experiments are required to untangle effects of environmental factors,
   such as water temperature and salinity on gene expression variations
   during the reproductive migration in G. przewalskii. In conclusion, our
   results profiled the transcriptomic alterations between reproductively
   dormant and active fish, suggesting that the LD condition in the summer
   was the principal signal to induce genes in neuroactive
   ligand-receptors and retinol metabolism in female and male brain. The
   synchronized upregulation of genes in GnRH signaling and sex hormone
   synthesis may promote gonad development and spawning migration in G.
   przewalskii.

Methods

Sample collection and RNA isolation

   Twelve reproductively active male (body weight = 102.6 ± 30.46 g) and
   female (body weight = 244.5 ± 51.64 g) G. przewalskii were captured in
   June 2015 in one of their spawning grounds, the Quanji River, which is
   connected to Lake Qinghai. Reproductively dormant male (body
   weight = 208.1 ± 60.11 g) and female (body weight = 197.8 ± 43.46 g)
   naked carp were collected in Lake Qinghai in November 2015. The field
   study was authorized by the Qinghai Provincal Bureau of Fishery. All
   the fish were sexually mature and over 3 years old. The age of each
   fish was estimated based on its anal scales, dorsal fin spines and
   otolith, according to a previous publication [[149]56]. Fish samples
   were euthanized with 200 mg/L MS222 (Sigma, USA), and tissues were
   harvested and transferred immediately to liquid nitrogen for RNA
   extraction. The animal experiment was conducted following the
   procedures and guidelines described in the “Guidelines for Animal Care
   and Use” manual approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee,
   Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

   Total RNA was purified from the brains and gonads of both male and
   female G. przewalskii in RS and NRS using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen,
   USA), followed by treatment with RNase free DNase I (Thermo Scientific,
   USA) to remove DNA contamination. The quality and quantity of RNA were
   verified with 1% agarose gel, NanoPhotometer® spectrophotometer
   (Implen, USA), Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, USA), and
   Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, USA).

Library preparation and sequencing

   For each sample, we purified RNA from both brain and gonad tissues to
   construct 2 sequencing libraries. The sequencing included 3 biological
   replicates of two genders collected in reproductive and nonreproductive
   seasons. In total, 24 libraries were sequenced. A total of 1.5 μg RNA
   was used for sequencing library construction. Sequencing libraries were
   built using the NEBNext® Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina®
   (NEB, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequencing
   tags were ligated to the sequence library of each sample. Briefly,
   mRNAs were purified from total RNAs using poly-T oligo-attached
   magnetic beads, which were fragmented using divalent cations in NEBNext
   First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5×). The first-strand cDNA was
   synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse
   Transcriptase (RNase H^−), and the second-strand cDNA was synthesized
   using DNA polymerase I and RNase H^−. Blunt ends were generated, and
   then, A was added at the 3′ ends, followed by the ligation of NEBNext
   adaptors for hybridization. The library molecules were selected for
   cDNA fragments of 150–200 bp. For library amplification, the PCR was
   carried out with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB, USA),
   universal PCR primers and index (X) primer. After purification of the
   PCR products, the library quality was measured by Qubit® 2.0
   Fluorometer (Life Technologies, USA) as well as Agilent Bioanalyzer
   2100 system (Agilent Technologies, USA). In total, 24 RNA-seq libraries
   were constructed and clustered using the cBot Cluster Generation System
   by TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina, USA) based on the
   manufacturer’s recommendations. Finally, the 24 libraries were
   sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq™ 4000 platform by GeneDenovo
   Biotechnology Co. (Guangzhou, China).

De novo assembly and annotation

   The raw data were separated and processed to remove adapters, poly-N
   containing reads (N% > 10%) and low-quality reads (quality score ≤ 10)
   using custom Perl scripts. Trinity software was applied with the
   default parameters to assemble clean reads [[150]57]. The assembled
   transcriptome was annotated by 4 public databases, including Nr,
   KOG/COG ([151]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/), Swiss-Prot
   ([152]http://www.expasy.ch/sprot) and KEGG
   ([153]http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) [[154]58]. We used the BLASTx program
   ([155]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) with an E-value less than
   1e-5 as the threshold.

DEG expression analysis

   Gene expression levels were estimated using RSEM, and RPKM was
   calculated to represent the expression level for each gene [[156]59].
   To obtain the gene expression value for each sample, we first removed
   rRNA reads from the clean reads. The filtered, high-quality clean reads
   were aligned to the assembled reference transcriptome using Bowtie2
   [[157]60], and read counts for each gene were recorded. The EdgeR
   package (v3.20.1) was used to analyze the read counts to determine
   differential expression. To control false discovery rate (FDR),
   p-values were adjusted based on Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach.
   Finally, genes with an adjusted p-value less than 0.05 and an absolute
   value of fold change greater than 2 were defined as DEGs [[158]61]. A
   clustering analysis was performed using pheatmap package in R, based on
   the RPKM of the DEGs.

DEG enrichment analysis

   Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for all DEGs was performed
   separately for down- and up-regulated genes by Blast2GO software
   [[159]62]. The functional classification of unigenes was performed
   using WEGO software [[160]63]. The significantly enriched GO terms were
   considered those with a p-value less than 0.05. The DEG-related KEGG
   pathways were obtained using KOBAS software [[161]64], and pathways
   with a p-value less than 0.05 were defined as significantly enriched
   pathways.

Gene expression validation by RT-qPCR

   The cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg total RNA with the M-Mul First
   Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Sangon Biotech, China). In the reverse
   transcription (RT) step, PCR water was used to replace RNA samples as
   the RT control. The PCR mixture included diluted RT products (1:5),
   SGExcel FastSYBR Mixture (Sangon Biotech, China) with forward and
   reverse primers in a final volume of 20 μl, which was incubated in ABI
   ViiA™ 7 platform (Applied Biosystems, USA). For each gene, 3 fish
   samples of similar weights were selected within each group as
   biological replicates to perform RT-qPCR validation. The RT-qPCR
   experiment was repeated 3 times as 3 independent experiments. The
   RT-qPCR conditions were as follows: initial incubation at 50 °C for
   2 min; 95 °C for 5 min; 40 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s and an annealing
   temperature for 30 s; 95 °C for 10 s; melt curve detection of 65 °C for
   5 s to 95 °C with an increment of 0.5 °C. Two types of control were
   applied, the RT control and a blank of PCR water, and no amplicon was
   observed in the real-time PCR controls. The gene expression level for
   each sample was calculated using the ΔΔCt method using as 18S rRNA
   internal control to normalize the data [[162]65]. We calculated the
   logFoldChange of 11 unigenes between the RS and NRS across FB, FG, MB
   and MG for both RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data. The Pearson correlation
   coefficient was estimated using all 44 pairs of data using the
   correlation function in the R environment. The primer information is
   listed in Additional file [163]10: Table S1.

Weighted gene coexpression network analysis

   To identify potential regulatory networks in the seasonal reproduction,
   we performed the WGCNA package (v1.47) in R [[164]66–[165]68]. The gene
   expression data was imported into WGCNA to generate coexpression
   modules using the blockwiseModule function for automatic network
   construction with default parameters. Modules were defined as clusters
   of highly interconnected genes. The eigengene of the module was the
   first principal component of a cluster of genes within the module,
   which represented the module’s gene expression profile. The grey module
   included genes that cannot be classified into any other modules. Genes
   in each module were subjected to Gene Ontolgy (GO) analysis and KEGG
   pathway enrichment tests. The intramodular connectivity of each gene
   was calculated using the softConnectivity function, and genes with high
   connectivity were considered as the hub genes. The networks were
   visualized using a free online platform
   ([166]http://www.omicshare.com/tools).
