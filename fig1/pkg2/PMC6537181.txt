Abstract

Background

   Mature fruit cracking during the normal season in African Pride (AP)
   atemoya is a major problem in postharvest storage. Our current
   understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying fruit cracking is
   limited. The aim of this study was to unravel the role starch
   degradation and cell wall polysaccharide metabolism in fruit ripening
   and cracking after harvest through transcriptome analysis.

Results

   Transcriptome analysis of AP atemoya pericarp from cracking fruits of
   ethylene treatments and controls was performed. KEGG pathway analysis
   revealed that the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway was
   significantly enriched, and approximately 39 DEGs could be functionally
   annotated, which included starch, cellulose, pectin, and other sugar
   metabolism-related genes. Starch, protopectin, and soluble pectin
   contents among the different cracking stages after ethylene treatment
   and the controls were monitored. The results revealed that ethylene
   accelerated starch degradation, inhibited protopectin synthesis, and
   enhanced the soluble pectin content, compared to the control, which
   coincides with the phenotype of ethylene-induced fruit cracking. Key
   genes implicated in the starch, pectin, and cellulose degradation were
   further investigated using RT-qPCR analysis. The results revealed that
   alpha-amylase 1 (AMY1), alpha-amylase 3 (AMY3), beta-amylase 1 (BAM1),
   beta-amylase 3 (BAM3), beta-amylase 9 (BAM9), pullulanase (PUL), and
   glycogen debranching enzyme (glgX), were the major genes involved in
   starch degradation. AMY1, BAM3, BAM9, PUL, and glgX all were
   upregulated and had higher expression levels with ethylene treatment
   compared to the controls, suggesting that ethylene treatment may be
   responsible for accelerating starch degradation. The expression profile
   of alpha-1,4-galacturonosyltransferase (GAUT) and granule-bound starch
   synthase (GBSS) coincided with protopectin content changes and could
   involve protopectin synthesis. Pectinesterase (PE), polygalacturonase
   (PG), and pectate lyase (PEL) all involved in pectin degradation; PE
   was significantly upregulated by ethylene and was the key enzyme
   implicated pectin degradation.

Conclusion

   Both KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs and material content
   analysis confirmed that starch decomposition into soluble sugars and
   cell wall polysaccharides metabolism are closely related to the
   ripening and cracking of AP atemoya. A link between gene up- or
   downregulation during different cracking stages of atemoya fruits and
   how their expression affects starch and pectin contents were
   established by RT-qPCR analysis.

Background

   African Pride (AP) belongs to atemoya (Annona cherimola Mill × A.
   squamosa L.), a semi-deciduous, exotic subtropical fruit that is
   consumed in various countries [[38]1]. It readily softens and cracks,
   thus reducing marketable yield and quality, and in turn promotes
   disease [[39]2]. Fruit cracking during atemoya ripening initially
   develops around the peduncle and then radiates outward from the fruit
   base. It can occur before and after harvest, and the amount varies with
   cultivar. A wide range of stimuli that varies among species triggers
   fruit cracking. Correlations have been observed between susceptibility
   of fruit cracking and specific fruit traits, such as shape [[40]3],
   size [[41]4], firmness [[42]5], stomata in fruit skin [[43]6],
   cuticular properties [[44]7], osmotic concentration, and other factors
   [[45]8]. Fruit cracking in AP atemoya more commonly occurs during
   postharvest storage. Some measures have been adopted to delay cracking,
   including low temperature storage, 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP)
   treatment [[46]9], chitosan and citric acid treatment [[47]10], and
   salicylic acid treatment [[48]11]. However, these could not effectively
   prevent fruit cracking, and our current understanding of the molecular
   mechanism underlying fruit cracking is limited.

   Atemoya is a fruit with typical climacteric maturation, and studies
   have shown that fruit cracking starts at the respiratory peak and as
   ethylene production increases [[49]2, [50]12–[51]14]. Generally,
   atemoya softening is accompanied by cracking. Sugar metabolism is the
   most important material transformation process in atemoya fruit
   ripening, including starch degradation, transformation, and cell
   polysaccharides metabolism. It has been reported that fruit softening
   is typically accompanied by the depolymerization and solubilization of
   various classes of cell wall polysaccharides, such as pectins and
   hemicelluloses, and by elevated levels of the expression of genes,
   proteins, and enzyme activities associated with cell wall degradation
   [[52]15, [53]16]. However, our current understanding of the molecular
   mechanism underlying fruit cracking is limited.

   Only a few studies on the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of
   atemoya cracking have been conducted to date. Several cell wall-related
   genes, cell wall relaxation factors, and cuticle-related genes have
   been identified, including polygalacturonase (PG), pectinesterase (PE),
   β-galactosidase (β-Gal), expansins (EXP), xyloglucan
   endotransglycosylase (XET), AP2/EREBP-type transcription factor
   (PaWINB), wax synthase (WS), and β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (PaKCS6)
   [[54]8, [55]17–[56]23], are associated with fruit softening and
   cracking. Whole genome sequencing of atemoya has not been performed to
   date, and only a few genetic resources are currently available. The
   objective of this study was to identify cracking-related metabolic
   pathways and genes in atemoya fruits after ethylene treatment and in
   controls during postharvest through transcriptome sequencing and to
   establish a solid foundation for future molecular studies using
   high-throughput sequencing and expression data analysis.

Results

Appearance, firmness, and TSS changes in atemoya fruits after ethylene
treatment and in controls

   AP summer fruits are generally ready to eat about 3 or 4 days after
   fruit harvest (80% ripening). When the skin color changes from dark
   green to light green [[57]14, [58]24], the surface of the fruit is
   cream in color between segments, and the surface of the separate fruit
   carpels becomes smooth [[59]2], the fruits are harvested. However, in
   addition to the above two conditions, the definition of 80% ripening
   also includes a 10% soluble solids content [[60]24]. Under room
   temperature and in the summer in Zhanjiang City, China, fruits started
   to separate between the peduncle and central axis 2 days after harvest
   as shown as NT-PC-1 in Fig. [61]1a. We used penetration tests to
   evaluate atemoya softening and found that the firmness value of fruits
   was too high to determine, but TSS levels at day 2 (11.6%) were higher
   than those on day 0/NT-0 (9.5%). On day 3, cracking radiated out from
   the fruit base, as shown as NT-PC-2 in Fig. [62]1a, and the fruits
   started to soften, allowing us to measure firmness. The TSS levels
   continued to increase to 21%. On day 4, cracking was deeper, radiating
   from the peduncle to the fruit top in some fruits, thereby completely
   exposing the peduncle as shown as NT-PC-3 in Fig. [63]1a. The firmness
   of the fruits rapidly decreased, and the highest TSS values (25%) were
   observed.

   Eth-24 h, Eth-PC, and Eth-NC for the ethylene treatment were selected
   for transcriptome sequencing. b Firmness values and TSS contents after
   ethylene and no treatments. Vertical bars represent the standard error
   of three biological replicates

   After 24 h of ethylene treatment (Eth-24 h), no difference in
   appearance between atemoya fruits on day 0/NT-0 was observed, although
   TSS content was slightly higher than that on day 0/NT-0. On day 2, the
   peel started to show signs of cracking, and regions around the peel had
   softened. On the third day, the fruits showed more extensive and deeper
   cracking, including the peduncle as shown as Eth-PC in Fig. [66]1a.
   Fruit firmness rapidly decreased and the highest TSS values were
   observed (Fig. [67]1b). However, some fruits subjected to ethylene
   treatment did not show signs of cracking, but exhibited similar changes
   in firmness and TSS content as that in cracking fruits shown as Eth-NC
   in Fig. [68]1.

Transcriptome sequencing, assembly, and annotation

   To obtain a reference transcriptome for cracking atemoya fruits, a
   RNA-Seq library was constructed using RNAs from the pericarp, and seven
   libraries were generated from untreated fruits at room temperature
   (NT-0, NT-PC-1, NT-PC-2, and NT-PC-3) and ethylene-treated fruits
   (Eth-24 h, Eth-PC, and Eth-NC) at different cracking phases. These
   libraries were sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq™ 2500 platform.
   Table [69]1 shows that we generated a total of 38 Gb of nucleotides
   with a Q30 percentage of 95%, and the percentage of unassigned “N”
   bases was nearly 0. The distribution of reads in the seven libraries
   was 50.9 million (13.34%) for the control (NT-0), 57.1 million (14.97%)
   for NT-PC-1, 49.4 million (12.95%) for NT-PC-2, 50.0 (13.10%) for
   NT-PC-3, and 69.58 million (14.97%) for Eth-24 h, 47.4 (18.23%) for
   Eth-PC, and 38.2 (12.42%) for Eth-NC. After cleaning and performing
   quality checks, the Trinity package was used to performed de novo
   assembly of 64,069 unigenes, with a mean size of 670 bp. The size
   distributions of these unigenes are shown in Additional file [70]1.
   After searching for homologous sequences using BLASTX against Nr,
   UniProt, GO, KEGG, and COG databases, a total of 39.14% (25,074/64,069)
   unigenes could be assigned to a homolog in all five databases
   (Fig. [71]2a). About 38.97% (24,967/64,069) of the unigenes could be
   annotated by BLASTx (E-value <1e-5) using the NCBI Nr database. Based
   on the E-value distribution, we found that approximately 42.56% of the
   unigenes showed very strong homology (E-value <1e-100) to available
   plant sequences (Fig. [72]2b). Figure [73]2c shows that approximately
   12,705 unigenes were annotated to five top-hit species, including
   Nelumbo nucifera, Vitis vinifera, Elaeis guineensis, and Glycine max.

   Approximately 17,039 unigenes could be classified into three GO
   categories, namely, cellular component, biological process, and
   molecular function (Additional file [77]2). In addition, 12,650 and
   5780 unigenes could be annotated according to UniProt and COG,
   respectively (Additional file [78]3). Around 4932 unigenes in the
   atemoya pericarp were mapped to 203 KEGG pathways
   (Additional file [79]4). The maps with the highest unigenes
   representation included metabolic pathways (map01100) and ribosome
   pathway (ko03010), followed by microbial metabolism in diverse
   environments (map01120), ribosome (map03010), plant hormone signal
   transduction (map04075), plant-pathogen interaction (map04626),
   spliceosome (map03040), RNA transport (map03013), protein processing in
   endoplasmic reticulum (map04141), ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis
   (map04120), and starch and sucrose metabolism (map00500) (Additional
   file [80]4).

Screening and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed
genes (DEGs)

   We measured the unigene expression levels based on the obtained unique
   reads from seven libraries using RPKM values (Additional file [81]5),
   and then screened out DEGs using the combined criteria of FDR ≤ 0.05
   and the |log2ratio| ≥ 1. The library generated from the pooled NT-0
   samples was used to normalize the DEGs in the other six libraries,
   which was then followed by pairwise comparisons. Changes in gene
   expression were determined by comparing NT-PC-1/NT-0, NT-PC-2/NT-0,
   NT-PC-3/NT-0, Eth-24 h/NT-0, Eth-PC/NT-0, and Eth-NC/NT-0,
   respectively. NT-PC-1/NT-0, NT-PC-2/NT-0, and NT-PC-3/NT-0 were defined
   as the first group, and Eth-24 h/NT-0, Eth-PC/NT-0, and Eth-NC/NT-0
   were designated as the second group. In these pairwise comparisons, we
   detected both unique and overlapping sets of DEGs. Figure [82]3a shows
   an enrichment of downregulated genes compared to upregulated genes
   during fruit softening and cracking. A total of 22,305, 30,072, and
   35,176 DEGs were detected by analyzing NT-PC-1/NT-0, NT-PC-2/NT-0, and
   NT-PC-3/NT-0, respectively. A total of 42,513 DEGs, including 15,767
   overlapping genes, were enriched during normal postharvest storage. For
   ethylene treatment, Eth-24 h/NT-0, Eth-PC/NT-0, and Eth-NC/NT-0, 49,497
   DEGs showed enrichment, which included 11,811 overlapping genes. By
   comparing the first group and the second group, a total of 54,819 DEGs,
   including 5322 unique genes in the first group, 12,306 unique genes in
   the second group, and 37,191 overlapping genes were obtained
   (Fig. [83]3b).

   representing the numbers of DEGs and the overlaps of sets obtained
   across three comparisons from two groups. Library form NT-0 pooled
   samples was used as calibrators to normalize the DEGs in other six
   libraries

   Four libraries, including NT-0, NT-PC-1, NT-PC-2, and NT-PC-3, were
   selected and used in DEG profiling, and these libraries did not undergo
   treatment and exhibited cracking during fruit ripening. The number of
   up-and downregulated DEGs was determined by paired comparison of the
   four libraries, which was then followed by KEGG pathway enrichment
   analysis. The top 20 KEGG pathways with the highest number of up- and
   downregulated DEGs are shown in Fig. [86]4. Starch and sucrose
   metabolism (ko00500), plant hormone signal transduction (ko04075),
   pentose and glucuronate interconversions (ko00040), and cyanoamino acid
   metabolism (ko00460) pathways were significantly enriched with
   upregulated DEGs and showed lower Q values. The KEGG pathways of plant
   hormone signal transduction (ko04075), starch and sucrose metabolism
   (ko00500), plant-pathogen interactions (ko04626), and ribosome
   biogenesis in eukaryotes (ko03008) were enriched with downregulated
   DEGs. Among the top 20 KEGG pathways that were enriched with up- and
   downregulated DEGs, starch and sucrose metabolism (ko00500) and plant
   hormone signal transduction (ko04075) showed the highest number of DEGs
   and lowest Q-value, thereby suggesting that these two pathways play
   important roles during atemoya softening and cracking.

   DEGs. The greater dot indicates the more number of genes, and the
   deeper red color indicates the smaller Q-value, on the contrary the
   deeper green color indicates the bigger Q-value

   A total of 44,697 DEGs were obtained by pairwise comparison of
   NT-PC-1/NT-0, NT-PC-2/NT-0, NT-PC-3/NT-0, NT-PC-1/NT-PC-2, and
   NT-PC-2/NT-PC-3, and DEG expression profiles were analyzed by STEM. To
   gain further insights into the biological processes involved in fruit
   cracking, the DEGs were divided into 25 clusters, of which 11
   represented distinct expression patterns. Figure [89]5 illustrates 11
   clusters comprising 26,177 DEGs with significant differential
   expression (P-value < 0.05), including seven downregulated patterns
   (Profiles 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, and 10) and four upregulated patterns
   (Profiles 15, 16, 24, and 25). The number of DEGs in each profile is
   shown in Additional file [90]6. A global description of the biological
   pathway enriched in each cluster of similarly regulated transcripts
   using KEGG pathway enrichment is presented in Fig. [91]5. The genes in
   clusters 0 and 1, including a broad range of genes responsible for
   “Ribosome”, “RNA transport”, “Spliceosome”, “Biosynthesis of amino
   acids”, and “Plant hormone signal transduction” were significantly
   downregulated from NT-0 to NT-PC-3. The genes from these two profiles
   mainly involved the degradation of materials in the basal metabolism
   pathway, which reflected the state of fruit maturation. Clusters 3, 4,
   and 5 contained genes that were initially downregulated and then
   subsequently upregulated. These findings suggest that these genes play
   roles in the later stages of storage (NT-PC-2 and NT-PC-3). These genes
   mostly belonged to the categories of Amino sugar and nucleotide sugar
   “metabolism”, “Ribosome”, “Protein processing in endoplasmic
   reticulum”, “Starch and sucrose metabolism”, “Spliceosom”, and “Plant
   hormone signal transduction”. The genes induced during the early stages
   of storage (NT-0 and NT-PC-1) and then subsequently downregulated were
   grouped into clusters 9 and 10. These genes were mainly involved in the
   “Carbon metabolism”, “Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis”, “Ribosome” and
   “Peroxisome” pathways and might be responsible for the degradation of
   materials during earlier stages. Clusters 15, 16, 24, and 25 contained
   genes that were upregulated during the entire storage stage. These
   genes are involved in “Starch and sucrose metabolism”, “Carbon
   metabolism”, “Plant hormone signal transduction”, “Pentose and
   glucuronate interconversions”, and “Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis”.
   The genes involved in “Starch and sucrose metabolism”, “Carbon
   metabolism”, and “Pentose and glucuronate interconversions” are all
   involved in sugar transformation, thereby confirming that sugar
   transformation plays an important role in atemoya fruit ripening and
   cracking, including the conversion of starch into soluble sugars and
   the degradation of soluble sugars into other forms to generate energy.

Quantitative real-time PCR validation of DEGs

   To further validate our RNA-seq results, we selected 16 unigenes for
   quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis. In the KEGG enrichment
   pathway, the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway and plant hormone
   signal transduction pathway both ranked higher. Atemoya is the fruit of
   the starch storage type [[94]25], and the degradation of starch and
   other sugars is an important metabolic process during ripening, which
   is closely related to fruit turgor pressure change [[95]8]. In the
   present research, some cracking-related genes belong to cell wall
   polysaccharides, which are included in the starch and sucrose
   metabolism pathway. In addition, plant hormone signal transduction also
   has been associated with fruit cracking in some fruits, for example
   Litchi [[96]26]. Thus, we selected 16 genes from these two metabolism
   pathways.

   RNA samples from atemoya pericarp after ethylene treatment and the
   controls in normal temperature were used as templates. These unigenes
   are involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, including starch,
   cellulose, sucrose, and trehalose and plant hormone signal transduction
   pathways, including ethylene, cytokinin, gibberellin, brassiosteroids,
   abscisic acid, and jasmonic acid. In the seven sampling stages, the
   expression profiles of the candidate unigenes coincided with the
   results of sequencing (Fig. [97]6a and b) and RNA-seq analysis (Pearson
   correlation coefficients R2 = 0.8021; Fig. [98]6c), thereby validating
   our transcriptome analysis.

Starch and sucrose metabolism pathway-related DEGs are involved in fruit
ripening and cracking

   KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs of each expression profile
   determined that the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway was
   significantly enriched in most clusters (Fig. [101]5). Table [102]2
   shows the number of the DEGs from 11 differential expression clusters
   that were involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway from
   NT-0 to NT-PC-3. A total of 39 DEGs were annotated in the starch and
   sucrose metabolism pathways, including starch, cellulose, pectin,
   sucrose, trehalose, maltose, glucose, fructose, and others.
   Approximately 114 unigenes were selected and used in heat map analysis
   (Fig. [103]7). The starch and sucrose metabolism pathway components are
   shown in Additional file [104]8.

   The data on gene expression levels were normalized. Each column
   represents an experimental sample (e.g., NT-0, NT-PC-1, NT-PC-2,
   NT-PC-3, Eth-24 h, Eth-PC, and Eth-NC), and each row represents a gene.
   The color scale at the right represents the log-transformed RPKM value,
   and expression differences are shown in different colors. Red indicates
   high expression, and green represents low expression

   In the starch metabolism pathway, there were four types of starch
   synthesis-related DEGs respectively encoding glgA (starch synthase),
   glgB (1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme), glgC (glucose-1-phosphate
   adenylyltransferase), and GBSS (granule-bound starch synthase). One
   glgA, 3 glgB, 1 glgC, and 2 GBSS were all downregulated from NT-0 to
   NT-PC-3 and after ethylene treatment during the entire storage period,
   whereas GBSS (comp126484_c0) was inhibited by ethylene compared to the
   control (Fig. [109]7a). Among the starch degradation-related unigenes,
   three types of unigenes respectively encoding AMYG (glucoamylase), PUL
   (pullulanase), and glgP (PYG starch phosphorylase) were enriched with a
   single gene (Table [110]2). Expression levels of AMYG and glgP slightly
   increased in NT-PC-1 and Eth-24 h, and then downregulated during the
   entire storage period, whereas PUL was upregulated both in normal
   storage conditions and after ethylene treatment (Fig. [111]7a). Two
   main types of starch-degrading enzymes encoding alpha-amylase (AMY) and
   beta-amylase (BAM) were enriched with six and seven unigenes,
   respectively (Fig. [112]7a and Table [113]2). There were four
   upregulated and two downregulated AMY unigenes, which exhibited similar
   expression patterns with normal storage conditions and after ethylene
   treatment. AMY (comp127079_c0) showed the highest expression levels,
   and AMY (comp104952_c0) was the second of six AMY unigenes that remains
   upregulated during the entire storage period, suggesting that these
   might play important roles in starch degradation. Seven BAM unigenes
   were enriched, of which five were upregulated, two were downregulated
   both with normal storage conditions and after ethylene treatment (Fig.
   [114]7a and Table [115]2). BAM (comp127079_c0) and BAM (comp127079_c1)
   had very high expression levels, higher than AMY (comp127079_c0) (Fig.
   [116]7a), whereas the two unigenes belonged to different fragments of
   the same gene, as indicated by BLAST. Compared to AMY, BAM might be the
   main enzyme of starch degradation. Four DEGs encoded glgX
   (glycogen-debranching enzyme), which included two downregulated and two
   upregulated genes both in normal storage conditions and after ethylene
   treatment. GlgX (comp129231_c0) induced higher expression with ethylene
   compared to the control. In the starch metabolism pathway, all of the
   synthetase genes were downregulated during fruit cracking, whereas most
   of the degradation-related genes, including AMY, BAM, PUL, and glgX,
   were upregulated. Together, these findings suggest that starch is
   extensively degraded during fruit ripening and cracking.

   The pericarp is directly involved in fruit cracking, and the components
   of the pericarp are closely related to the development of cracking
   resistance. Most of the cell wall components are polysaccharides, such
   as cellulose and pectin. Enriched cellulose-related genes mainly encode
   cellulose-degrading enzymes, including two kinds of genes, namely,
   endoglucanase and beta-glucosidase. Two endoglucanase genes and 16
   beta-glucosidase genes were enriched, of which 1 endoglucanase and 2
   beta-glucosidase genes were upregulated and 1 endoglucanase and 14
   beta-glucosidase were downregulated both with normal storage conditions
   and after ethylene treatment (Fig. [117]7c and Table [118]2). In 14
   downregulated unigenes, the expression of 5 beta-glucosidase genes,
   including comp119470_c2, comp121604_c0,comp129279_c0,comp130397_c0, and
   comp130269_c0, were induced to different degrees using Eth-24 h,
   whereas these were continuously downregulated from NT-0 to NT-PC-3 with
   normal storage conditions (Fig. [119]7c).

   An enrichment of pectin metabolism-related unigenes was also observed,
   except for GAUT (alpha-1,4- galacturonosyltransferase) that
   participates in pectin synthesis, as well as PE (pectinesterase), PG
   (polygalacturonase), and PEL (pectate lyase), which are involved in
   pectin degradation. Ten unigenes encoding GAUT were differentially
   expressed, of which three presented upregulated profiles, and the rest
   were downregulated both under normal storage conditions and after
   ethylene treatment. There were 11 PE, 12 PG, and 6 PEL unigenes that
   were respectively enriched, of which 8, 12, and 5 were upregulated both
   in normal storage conditions and after ethylene treatment (Fig. [120]7b
   and Table [121]2). Two PE unigenes (comp124968_c0 and comp127036_c0),
   three PG unigenes (comp120584_c0,comp123401_c0, and comp120584_c1), and
   two PEL unigenes (comp122322_c0 and comp116480_c1) presented higher
   expression than other pectin-degrading enzymes genes both under normal
   storage conditions and after ethylene treatment, but there were no
   obvious differences between the controls and ethylene treatment (Fig.
   [122]7b). An enrichment of pectin-degrading enzymes was also observed,
   and most of these were upregulated, which suggested that pectin
   degradation was intimately linked to fruit ripening and cracking.
   Several unigenes encoding TPS (trehalose 6-phosphate
   synthase/phosphatase), malQ (4-alpha-glucanotransferase), scrK
   (fructokinase), SS (sucrose synthase), 1,3-beta-glucan synthase, UXS1
   (UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase), and other sugar metabolism-related
   genes are involved in trehalose, maltose, sucrose, fructose, and
   glucose metabolism pathways, which ware responsible for converting all
   kinds of polysaccharides into monosaccharides. The contribution of
   different kinds of sugars to osmotic pressure varies, with
   monosaccharides providing the largest contribution, and the rate of
   conversion of polysaccharides to monosaccharides can influence osmotic
   pressure. Therefore, enrichment analysis of sugar-related genes may
   identify the major sugars that are metabolized in atemoya fruits and
   their possible effects on changes in osmotic pressure during fruit
   cracking. According to enriched sugar related-genes, trehalose,
   sucrose, fructose, glucose, and maltose are the major soluble sugars in
   sugar metabolism during fruit ripening. Most of these were
   downregulated during the entire storage period; nevertheless, some of
   these had high expression levels at NT-0, NT-PC-1 and Eth-24 h, e.g.,
   SS (comp122833_c0), scrK (comp122886_c1), TREH
   (alpha,alpha-trehalase)(comp124814_c1), UDP-glucuronate 4-epimerase
   (comp127368_c1), and UXS1 (comp121018_c0) (Fig. [123]7d and e). The
   above results only preliminarily identified the major types of sugar,
   and the next step is to quantify the contents of the major sugars at
   each stage to determine the conversion rate of sugars and their effect
   on osmotic pressure.

Changes in starch and pectin contents and their metabolism-related genes
expression profiles

   Figure [124]8a shows that starch content decreased during fruit
   storage, and ethylene treatment accelerated starch degradation.
   Protopectin content in the pericarp without treatment increased until
   day 4, whereas it decreased after day 1 with ethylene treatment
   (Fig. [125]8b), which indicated that ethylene inhibited the synthesis
   of the protopectin. Figure [126]8c shows that soluble pectin content
   increased during fruit storage, and ethylene treatment enhanced soluble
   pectin content compared to no treatment, which suggests that ethylene
   treatment accelerates pectin degradation.

   is shown in the graph (p-value < 0.05). Asterisks (*) indicate
   significant differences in starch, protopectin, and soluble pectin
   content between CK and Eth at the same day

   To shed light on which genes play important roles in starch and cell
   wall polysaccharide metabolism pathways during fruit cracking, the
   expression profiles of 12 unigenes were analyzed. Among these, AMY3
   (comp128642_c0), BAM1 (comp126323_c0), and BAM9 (comp127550_c0) that
   were validated by RT-qPCR (Fig. [129]6a). Nine starch-degrading
   enzymes, namely, AMY1 (comp104952_c0), AMYG (comp124474_c0), BAM3
   (comp127079_c0), PUL (comp128177_c0), glgX (comp129444_c0), glgP
   (comp124413_c0), AMY3, BAM1, BAM9, and one starch synthesis gene glgB
   (comp125073_c0), were selected (Fig. [130]9a). Among these, except for
   glgP and AMYG, the expression of the other degrading enzyme genes were
   significantly upregulated, whereas that of the synthesis genes
   decreased during fruit cracking after ethylene treatment and in the
   controls. AMY1, BAM3, BAM9, PUL, and glgX were all upregulated and
   exhibited higher expression levels with ethylene treatment compared to
   without treatment, which could be responsible for accelerating starch
   degradation after ethylene treatment. With ethylene treatment and in
   the controls, AMY1 and BAM3 were significantly expressed, which
   indicated these two genes are the key genes of starch degradation.

   GAUT is the key pectin synthesis enzyme [[134]27]. High amounts of GAUT
   (comp126456_c0) accumulated during the first three stages, with a
   reduction at the fourth stage with controls and ethylene treatments,
   and higher expression levels under controls compared to ethylene
   treatment, whereas its expression profile coincided with changes in
   protopectin content, which could account for protopectin synthesis
   during fruit cracking and softening (Fig. [135]9b). PE (comp124968_c0),
   PG (comp130329_c0), and PEL (comp122322_c0) were upregulated with or
   without ethylene treatment, which indicated that these three genes play
   important roles in pectin degradation. Among these, PE was
   significantly upregulated by ethylene, and thus might be the key gene
   involved in pectin degradation (Fig. [136]9b). Beta-glucosidase
   (comp127164_c0) was upregulated by ethylene, indicating that it could
   be a major cellulose degradation enzyme (Fig. [137]9b).

Discussion

   Several factors influence fruit cracking, including genetics,
   morphology, physiology, environmental conditions (e.g., temperature,
   wind and light), and orchard management (e.g., irrigation and
   nutrition). Furthermore, fruit cracking is a quantitative trait that is
   controlled by several genes [[138]8]. To generate molecular evidence
   and elucidate the mechanism underlying fruit cracking, the present
   study attempted to identify fruit cracking genes in atemoya during
   postharvest storage. To circumvent the unavailability of an atemoya
   reference genome, we utilized the pericarp of cracking atemoya fruits
   for RNA-seq in the de novo assembly of a reference transcriptome. Our
   assembly contains a total of 64,069 unigenes with a mean size of
   670 bp. Approximately 25,074 unigenes were annotated to public protein
   databases. We performed a pairwise comparison and identified 42,513
   DEGs between NT-0 and NT-PC-1, NT-PC-2, and NT-PC-3 and 49,497 DEGs
   between NT-0 and Eth-24 h, Eth-PC, and Eth-NC. KEGG pathway enrichment
   analysis of all DEGs and DEGs of each distinct expression patterns
   indicated that the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway was
   significantly enriched.

   The present study determined that in cherimoya, carbohydrates are
   mainly stored in the form of starch [[139]28]. Scanning electron
   microscope (SEM) analysis of AP atemoya indicated numerous starch
   granules in the fruit tissues [[140]29]. Thus, the cells of the atemoya
   fruit not only store starch but also use this to maintain cell turgor
   [[141]30]. Mo et al. [[142]11] suggested that the firmness of Annona
   fruits dramatically decreases with ripening, possibly due to
   transformation of starch into soluble sugars. Wills et al. [[143]31]
   showed that the initiation of cracking coincides with the decline in
   about one-fifth of the starch level in fruits. Paull [[144]14]
   suggested that atemoya cracking commonly occurs during postharvest
   because of changes in osmotic and subsequent turgor, which are related
   to the production of neutral sugars during ripening, which leads to the
   movement of water from the skin and receptacle to the flesh. Previous
   studies have revealed that starch degradation induces changes in fruit
   turgor, and fruit softening and cracking are closely related; however,
   these were mainly observed at the physiological level. In the present
   study, transcriptome sequencing revealed that fruit cracking is
   strongly associated with a significant enrichment of several starch
   metabolism genes, including 7 starch synthase genes and 17 starch
   degrading enzymes. At the transcriptional level, the transformation of
   starch to soluble sugars may be one of the most important processes in
   fruit softening and cracking. Unigenes encoding starch synthase were
   all downregulated, whereas starch degradation genes were mostly
   upregulated. For example, AMY1 (comp104952_c0) and BAM3 (comp127079_c0)
   were significantly induced and highly expressed during fruit cracking,
   which suggests that these are key to starch degradation, and
   simultaneously showed that starch is rapidly decomposed by amylase
   during postharvest. We also showed that starch degradation is related
   to fruit cracking, which coincides with the results of previous studies
   on physiological metabolism.

   Soluble sugar content affects fruit turgor, thereby leading to fruit
   cracking. Previous studies on sweet cherry, wax apple, litchi, grapes,
   and other fruits have confirmed that the soluble sugar content is
   higher and osmotic potential is lower in cracking fruits than those
   without cracking [[145]20, [146]32–[147]34], which indicates that
   water, soluble sugar, and osmotic potential are closely related to
   fruit cracking. Lu and Lin [[148]20] reported that the TSS content and
   total titratable acid levels were both 20% higher in cracked fruits
   than in non-cracked fruits of wax apple. Furthermore, when its turgor
   pressure was 60% higher, an increase in TSS content and total
   titratable acid levels during fruit maturation was observed, which in
   turn leads to a decrease in tissue osmotic potential. Considine and
   Kriedemann [[149]32] provided direct evidence for the importance of
   fruit soluble solids, wherein cracking in grapes occurs when these are
   submerged in solutions of low osmotic potential. Atemoya fruits are of
   the starch storage type [[150]25], and the rate and ability to undergo
   starch degradation during postharvest is directly related to soluble
   sugar content, which in turn directly affects fruit turgor [[151]8].
   Therefore, factors influencing starch degradation rate, such as
   temperature and ethylene, could also influence the degree of fruit
   cracking. Under low temperature, TSS content of cherimoya fruits slowly
   increased, whereas no detectable change in pH value was observed
   [[152]35, [153]36], which suggests that low temperature treatment of
   cherimoya results in a decrease in the rate of starch hydrolysis and
   monosaccharide concentration, and these findings agree with the results
   of our investigation in atemoya [[154]37]. Gutiérrez et al. [[155]28]
   determined using ultrastructural analysis of fruits that starch grains
   do not break down, and the cell walls remain intact after 6 d of
   storage at 4 °C. Except for low temperature, our previous research
   suggests that ethylene could significantly accelerate cracking and
   ripening in atemoya, and the pericarp cracks first after 2 g/kg of
   ethephon treatment, which is different from the control treatment
   [[156]22]. This research found that ethylene accelerated starch
   degradation and enhanced the content of soluble pectin, compared to the
   control, suggesting that ethylene accelerates fruit cracking and
   ripening. Transcriptome analysis suggests a strong association between
   the degradation of starch, pectin, and cellulose, and the upregulation
   of AMY1 (comp104952_c0), BAM3 (comp127079_c0), BAM9 (comp127550_c0),
   PUL (comp128177_c0), glgX (comp129444_c0), PE (comp124968_c0) and
   beta-glucosidase (comp127164_c0). In addition, the ethylene treatment
   not only promoted the increase of soluble pectin, but also inhibited
   the synthesis of the propectin, which could explain why the pericarp
   cracks first after ethylene treatment. At the transcriptional level,
   GAUT (comp126456_c0) is mainly involved in the synthesis of the
   propectin. The above research showed that the external environment
   temperature and ethylene treatment could be directly related to the
   time and extent of fruit cracking by regulating the metabolism of
   starch and cell wall polysaccharides.

   Previous studies have found that starch is transformed into various
   kinds of soluble sugars such as disaccharides (e.g., sucrose) and
   monosaccharides (e.g., fructose and glucose). Paull et al. [[157]38]
   reported that in soursop, sucrose content increased by four-fold at
   maturity, and the highest concentration was observed at 3 days after
   harvest, which subsequently decreased to 40%. Fructose and glucose
   content then slowly increase until 5 days after harvest. The ratio of
   sucrose, glucose, and fructose at the edible ripe stage was 4.3:3.0:3.2
   [[158]39]. However, in cherimoya (Annona cherimola Mill. cv. ‘Fino de
   Jete’), starch is mainly converted into glucose and fructose in
   equimolar concentrations, with little and transient accumulation of
   sucrose [[159]28, [160]40]. In our research, some genes that were
   involved with sucrose, fructose, and glucose were enriched, such as
   sucrose-metabolizing enzymes, SS and alpha-glucosidase (YihQ), and
   fructose metabolism-related enzymes, scrK, and hexokinase (HK), glucose
   metabolism genes, and glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase. Furthermore,
   trehalose metabolism-related genes, including eight trehalose
   6-phosphate synthase (TPS) genes, three trehalose 6-phosphate
   phosphatase (otsB) genes, one TREH gene, and three maltose
   metabolism-related genes malQ, were enriched. The degradation of starch
   produces maltose, whereas previous studies have shown that trehalose is
   rarely involved in starch transformation of Annona fruits. Recent
   studies have observed that trehalose in plants is also involved in
   metabolism and gene expression regulation and affects plant growth,
   development, and responses to changes in the external environment
   [[161]41, [162]42]. Trehalose is a typical stress metabolism and
   protective substance, and when the organism is under stress, it can
   quickly accumulate trehalose [[163]43, [164]44]. The role of trehalose
   during atemoya postharvest requires further investigation.

   Researchers have found that some cell wall-related genes, which include
   EXP, XET, PG, and PE, also play roles in fruit cracking [[165]8,
   [166]21]. Shen et al. [[167]19] suggested that during cracking and
   ripening of fruits in the field, the expression of AsEXP1 and AsEXP3
   are relatively high, whereas that of AsEXP2 is relatively weak. Wang et
   al. [[168]17] reported that the differential expression of LcEXP1 and
   LcEXP2 in the litchi pericarp is related to fruit growth and resistance
   to crack formation. Our previous research [[169]22] compared
   cracking-susceptible cultivars with cracking- resistant cultivars of
   atemoya during postharvest storage and we found that EXP1 is more
   relevant to fruit maturity and softening. EXP2, EXP3, and PE were more
   closely related to fruit cracking, whereas XET1, XET2, and XET3 might
   be related to fruit softening and are unlikely key genes of fruit
   cracking [[170]22]. Lu and Lin [[171]20] reported a 131% increase in PG
   activity in cracked fruits compared to non-cracked wax apple fruits. In
   the present research, transcriptome sequencing analysis found that
   except for 12 PG and 11 PE, another pectin degradation-related gene, 6
   PEL, was enriched, suggesting that pectin decomposition is also an
   important polysaccharide metabolism process in atemoya fruit cracking.
   At the physiological level, combining part of the gene expression
   evidences from previous researches with our RNA-seq results strengthens
   our theory that atemoya fruit cracking is caused by the transformation
   of starch into soluble sugars that in turn increases turgor pressure,
   thereby resulting in the rupture of cells and tissues, as well as the
   degradation of cell wall polysaccharides such as pectin and cellulose,
   ultimately decreasing cell wall toughness, which is exhibited as
   cracking of the pericarp and flesh.

   RT-qPCR analysis indicated an enrichment of numerous starch, pectin,
   and cellulose metabolism-related genes, which were predominated by AMY1
   (comp104952_c0), BAM3 (comp127079_c0), PUL (comp128177_c0), glgX
   (comp129444_c0), PE (comp124968_c0), PG (comp130329_c0), PEL
   (comp122322_c0), and beta-glucosidase (comp127164_c0). Since the
   present study was designed as a preliminary validation, additional
   studies looking into the kind of relationship between these genes and
   fruit cracking are warranted. In addition, fruit cracking is a complex
   physiological phenomenon in that no single gene directly controls the
   process. However, transcriptome sequencing has provided molecular
   evidence that starch and cell wall polysaccharides may both be involved
   in fruit cracking, as well as useful genetic resources for screening
   additional fruit cracking-related genes.

   In addition to the important role of starch and sucrose metabolism
   pathway in atemoya fruit cracking, studies have shown that plant
   hormone signal transduction pathways are also involved in fruit
   cracking. Spraying different concentrations of gibberellin on cherries,
   pomegranates, and litchi can reduce fruit cracking rate
   [[172]45–[173]47]. In litchi and pomegranate, ABA content in pericarp
   is higher in cracking fruits than in the healthy fruits [[174]48,
   [175]49], and spraying ABA increases the fruit cracking rate of litchi
   [[176]11]. These researchers suggest that spraying GA can reduce fruit
   cracking, but spraying ABA can increase fruit cracking in some fruits.
   Li et al. [[177]26] performed comparative transcriptomic analyses of
   non-cracking and cracking litchi fruits and found that plant hormone
   signal transduction pathway-related genes have been enriched, including
   GA and ABA. They believe that lower GA levels and higher ABA levels in
   pericarp lead to slower pressure expansion of the pericarp, so that
   aril cells produce more turgor against the skin, thereby leading to
   fruit cracking. In our results, the enriched number of DEGs of the
   plant hormone signal transduction pathway ranked fourth in all
   metabolism pathways, consisting of a total of 154 DEGs, including
   gibberellin, abscisic acid, and cytokinins (Additional 4), whereas we
   did not focus on plant hormone-related genes in this study, and thus
   their role in fruit cracking requires further investigation.

Conclusions

   In summary, seven sets of transcriptome data comprising 64,069 unigenes
   in the atemoya pericarp were generated by Illumina sequencing. Both
   KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs and material content analysis
   confirmed that starch decomposition into soluble sugars and cell wall
   polysaccharides metabolism are closely related to the ripening and
   cracking of the AP atemoya. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the
   differential expression of genes during different cracking stages of
   the atemoya fruit influences starch and pectin content. In addition,
   plant hormone signal transduction pathway-related genes were
   significantly enriched, suggesting their role in fruit ripening and
   cracking. The present study may serve as a valuable resource for future
   atemoya genomic studies and may also benefit investigations involving
   other closely related agricultural species. The DEG dataset may also
   provide useful candidate genes for the elucidation of the mechanism
   underlying fruit cracking in atemoya and other fruits.

Methods

Plant materials and experimental design

   In the present study, AP atemoya fruits were collected from the Base of
   National Field Genebank for Tropical Fruit at South Subtropical Crops
   Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences,
   Zhanjiang, Guangdong, China. The orchard is located at 21°12′
   N,110°4′E. Material collection was conducted in accordance with local
   legislation, and there was no need for permission from other
   organizations. We complied with the Convention on the Trade in
   Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Fruits were harvested in
   October, when fruit skin color changed from darker to lighter green and
   can be greenish yellow, and those free of blemishes and mechanical
   damage were collected [[178]14].

   The first sublots of fruits were used for transcriptome sequencing. The
   atemoya fruits were picked at about 80% ripening. Twenty fruits were
   kept at room temperature with no treatment, and recently picked fruits
   were defined as day 0 or NT-0. Most of the fruits without any treatment
   started to crack at the pedicel on day 2 and were named NT-PC-1,
   whereas splits increased and deepened on day 3 (NT-PC-2) and day 4
   (NT-PC-2) with prolonged storage time. The following four stages were
   selected for transcriptome sequencing: recently picked fruits (NT-0),
   cracking at the pedicel (NT-PC-1), moderate cracking at the pedicel
   (NT-PC-2), and severe cracking at the pedicel (NT-PC-3). Another 20
   fruits were immersed in 2 g/kg ethephon for 2 min, transferred into a
   closed plastic box, and the lid was left open after 24 h. Fruits that
   did not exhibit cracking after 24 h of ethephon treatment were
   designated as Eth-24 h. Most fruits initially exhibited cracking in the
   pericarp on day 2 and were named Eth-PC. On day 3, the fruits showed
   more extensive and deeper cracking, including the pericarp and the
   peduncle. However, not all of the fruits after ethephon treatment
   appeared cracking, and no-cracking fruits were defined as Eth-NC on day
   4 after ethephon treatment. Samples were collected from three stages
   for transcriptome sequencing, including fruits 24 h after ethephon
   treatment (Eth-24 h), fruits with pericarp cracking after ethephon
   treatment (Eth-PC), and no fruit cracking after ethephon treatment
   (Eth-NC).

   Three pericarp samples that showed similar TSS contents, firmness
   values, and degree of cracking under the same treatment at each stage
   were collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored
   at − 80 °C until further processing. Three replicate samples were
   prepared for each biological sample. The pericarps of the candidate
   samples, including NT-0, NT-PC-1, NT-PC-2, NT-PC-3, Eth-24 h, Eth-PC,
   and Eth-NC, were subjected to transcriptome sequencing and expression
   analysis.

   The second sublots of fruits were used for starch and pectin content
   determination. Fifteen fruits were stored at room temperature with no
   treatment, and another 15 fruits were treated with ethephon as earlier
   described. Samples were collected on days 0, 1, 3, and 5. Three
   pericarp samples at each stage were collected, immediately frozen in
   liquid nitrogen, and then stored at − 80 °C until further processing.

Total soluble solids (TSS), firmness value, starch, and pectin determination

   TSS content and firmness were measured as previously described
   [[179]22]. A solution of 80% Ca (NO[3])[2] was used to extract starch
   from the ethanol-insoluble residue, and the absorption value of the
   reaction product at a wavelength of 620 nm was determined using the
   iodine-iodide kalium method according to the method of Cao et al.
   [[180]50]. A solution of 95% ethanol was used to extract pectin in a
   boiling water bath. The supernatant was used to determine soluble
   pectin, and the ethanol-insoluble residue hydrolyzed by sulfuric acid
   was used to measure protopectin content according to the method Cao et
   al. [[181]50]. Pectin was determined by carbazole, and the content of
   pectin was indicated by the quality of galacturonic acid.

RNA extraction and illumina sequencing for transcriptome analysis

   Seven libraries (NT-0, NT-PC-1, NT-PC-2, NT-PC-3, Eth-24 h, Eth-PC, and
   Eth-NC) were designed for RNA- Seq to obtain a general overview of the
   atemoya pericarp transcriptome of fruit ripening and cracking. Total
   RNA was extracted from pericarp tissues using a Quick RNA isolation kit
   following the manufacturer’s instructions (Huayueyang, China). The RNA
   samples were digested with DNase I to remove possible contaminating
   genomic DNA and purified with RNase-free columns (Huayueyang, China).
   RNA quality was verified using a 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA Nanochip
   (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and RNA integrity was confirmed by
   electrophoresis on formaldehyde-containing 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels.
   Then, RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer
   (Nano-Drop, Wilmington, DE, USA). Three high-quality RNAs were pooled
   by mixing equal quantities of RNA of the three biological replicates
   used in RNA-seq at each stage. Each library was sequenced in an
   Illumina HiSeq 2500 system using 100-bp paired-end protocols. All of
   the raw transcriptome data were deposited to the GenBank Short Read
   Archive (Accession number SRP114346).

De novo assembly and functional annotation

   The resulting RNA sequencing data were subjected to purification, which
   included removing adapters and low-quality reads. Clean reads were de
   novo assembled using the Trinity Program [[182]51]. The resulting
   sequences obtained with Trinity were then called unigenes. To annotate
   the unigenes, we used the BLASTx program
   ([183]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) of NCBI with an E-value
   threshold of 1e− 5 to the NCBI non-redundant protein (Nr) database
   ([184]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), the Universal Protein Resource
   (UniProt) database ([185]http://www.uniprot.org/), the Kyoto
   Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database
   ([186]http://www.genome.jp/kegg), the Gene Ontology (GO) database
   ([187]http://geneontology.org/), and the Cluster of Orthologous Groups
   of protein (COG) database ([188]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG).
   Unigene expression level was normalized by calculating reads per kb per
   million reads (RPKM) [[189]52]. Comparison of unigene expression among
   treatments was according to DEGSeq as described by Anders and Huber
   [[190]53] and Wang et al. [[191]54]. DEGs between treated and control
   samples were identified when the false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05,
   |log2ratio| ≥ 1, and P-value < 0.05. The library prepared from the NT-0
   pooled samples was used as calibrators to normalize the DEGs in the
   other six libraries (NT-PC-1, NT-PC-2, NT-PC-3, Eth-24 h, Eth-PC, and
   Eth-NC). DEGs were clustered by Short Time-series Expression Miner
   software (STEM) [[192]55]. The clustered profiles with a P-value ≤0.05
   were considered to be significantly expressed. Then the DEGs were
   subjected to KEGG pathway annotation using Blast all software against
   the KEGG database. KEGG pathways with a Q-value ≤0.05 are significantly
   enriched in DEGs. Senior bubble charts were constructed using the
   OmicShare tools, a free online platform for data analysis
   ([193]www.omicshare.com/tools). To understand the gene expression
   patterns of DEGs during fruit cracking, we performed a hierarchical
   cluster analysis of expression patterns with cluster software [[194]56]
   and Java TreeView [[195]57].

RT-qPCR validation

   RT-qPCR was applied to investigate gene expression patterns.
   First-strand cDNA was generated from 1 μg total RNA isolated from the
   seven pericarp samples using the PrimeScript™ RT reagent kit with gDNA
   Eraser (TaKaRa, Japan). RT-qPCR primers for were designed using Primer
   Premier 5.0 software (Premier, Canada) and synthesized by Sangon
   Biotech (Shanghai, China) Co., Ltd. The atemoya homologue actin
   (GenBank Accession Number [196]MF893339) was selected as reference. All
   of the primers of the candidate unigenes are shown in
   Additional file [197]7. Each reaction (final volume: 10 μL) contained
   5 μL of 2× SYBR Green mastermix (Thermo Fisher), 1 μL of each of the
   forward and reverse primers (0.25 mM), 1 μL of the cDNA template, and
   2 μL of RNase-free water. RT-qPCR was conducted in a LightCycler 480
   system (Roche, USA) using the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min,
   followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for
   30 s in 96-well optical reaction plates. Each RT-qPCR analysis was
   performed in triplicate. Expression levels of the tested reference
   genes were determined by CT values and calculated using 2^-△△Ct
   [[198]58].

Statistical analysis

   All of the measurements were repeated thrice. All of the data were
   subjected to ANOVA according to the model for a completely randomized
   design using SPSS software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Differences
   between two sample evaluated by t test at the 0.05 level in starch and
   pectin determination and differences among more samples were evaluated
   by Duncan’s test at the 0.05 level in RT-qPCR analysis.
