Here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis details as described in the provided text, formatted for a table:

| **Question** | **Answer** |
|---|---|
| 1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | KOBAS software |
| 2. Was a tool version number provided? | Not described |
| 3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)? | KEGG |
| 4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis? | Not described |
| 5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis? | Not described |
| 6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis? | Yes, Benjamini and Hochbergâ€™s approach was used to adjust the obtained P-values. |

**Important Note:** The level of detail provided in the text is limited. Several aspects, like the specific statistical test used within KOBAS, and the definition of a background gene list, are *not* explicitly mentioned.
