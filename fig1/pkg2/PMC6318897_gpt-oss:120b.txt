Thinking...
We need to answer six questions about pathway enrichment analysis. We must extract from article text.

Let's scan the Methods section for "DEG enrichment analysis". In Methods:

"DEG enrichment analysis

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for all DEGs was performed separately for down- and up-regulated genes by Blast2GO software [62]. The functional classification of unigenes was performed using WEGO software [63]. The significantly enriched GO terms were considered those with a p-value less than 0.05. The DEG-related KEGG pathways were obtained using KOBAS software [64], and pathways with a p-value less than 0.05 were defined as significantly enriched pathways."

So tools: Blast2GO for GO enrichment. KOBAS for KEGG pathway enrichment. Also they used WEGO for functional classification (but that's not enrichment; it's classification). The question: "What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?" So KOBAS is a tool for KEGG pathway enrichment. Also Blast2GO for GO enrichment. They also used WEGO but not enrichment. So answer includes Blast2GO and KOBAS.

Version numbers? Not described.

Gene set libraries: GO, KEGG. They also used "KOG" but that's for annotation, not enrichment. So answer: GO, KEGG.

Custom background gene list? Not described. They didn't mention using a specific background list.

Statistical test(s) used: Not described. The article just says "pathways with a p-value less than 0.05 were defined as significantly enriched". No test mentioned.

Multiple testing correction applied? Not described. They only mention p-value threshold.

Now we need to format a table with columns: Question, Answer.

But we need separate lines for multiple tools.

Let's produce a table with rows for each question.

Possible format:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Tool used for pathway enrichment analysis | Blast2GO; KOBAS |
| Enrichment tool version(s) | Not described |
| Gene set libraries used | GO; KEGG |
| Custom background gene list used? | Not described |
| Statistical test(s) used | Not described |
| Multiple testing correction applied? | No (or Not described) |

But we must choose between No or Not described. The article does not describe using a background list, so answer "Not described". For statistical test: Not described. For multiple testing correction: No (they didn't mention FDR). However they used "p-value threshold less than 0.05". That's not multiple testing correction. So answer "No".

Thus table.

...done thinking.
