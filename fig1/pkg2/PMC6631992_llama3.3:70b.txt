Here are the answers to your questions:

1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?
The tool used for pathway enrichment analysis is ToppFun, which is part of the ToppGene suite.

2. Was a tool version number provided?
Not described.

3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?
The gene set libraries queried are GO (Gene Ontology) and possibly others, as the article mentions "GO functional enrichment analysis" and also mentions miRNA targets from various databases (PITA, TOP).

4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described.

5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?
Not described, but the article mentions that the results were obtained through ToppFun, which likely uses a hypergeometric test or similar statistical method for enrichment analysis.

6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?
Yes, the article mentions that the results were corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, as indicated by the mention of "FDR: False discovery rate; B&H: Benjamini-Hochberg".
