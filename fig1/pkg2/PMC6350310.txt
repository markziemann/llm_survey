Abstract

Background

   Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one major form of inflammatory bowel
   disease. The cause and the pathophysiology of the disease are not fully
   understood and we therefor aim in this study to identify important
   pathophysiological features in UC from proteomics data.

Methods

   Colon mucosa biopsies from inflamed tissue of untreated UC patients at
   diagnosis and from healthy controls were obtained during colonoscopy.
   Quantitative protein data was acquired by bottom-up proteomics and
   furthermore processed with MaxQuant. The quantitative proteome data was
   analyzed with Perseus and enrichment data was analyzed by ClueGO for
   Cytoscape.

Results

   The generated proteome dataset is to-date the deepest from colon mucosa
   biopsies with 8562 identified proteins whereof 6818 were quantified in
   > 70% of the samples. We report abundance differences between UC and
   healthy controls and the respective p values for all quantified
   proteins in the supporting information. From this data set enrichment
   analysis revealed decreased protein abundances in UC for
   metallothioneins, PPAR-inducible proteins, fibrillar collagens and
   proteins involved in bile acid transport as well as metabolic functions
   of nutrients, energy, steroids, xenobiotics and carbonate. On the other
   hand increased abundances were enriched in immune response and protein
   processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, e.g. unfolded protein response
   and signal peptidase complex proteins.

Conclusions

   This explorative study describes the most affected functions in UC
   tissue. Our results complemented previous findings substantially.
   Decreased abundances of signal peptidase complex proteins in UC are a
   new discovery.

Background

   Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
   The chronic inflammation of the colon in UC starts at the rectum and
   can progress continuously to proximal colon parts. UC affects 0.51% of
   the European and 0.25% of the North American population, with
   increasing prevalence [[36]1]. The disease has a complex
   pathophysiology and the exact disease causes remain unclear. A genetic
   component, environmental factors, defects of the epithelial barrier,
   and dysregulated immune responses are involved [[37]2].

   Pathophysiological changes likely lie or are reflected in the abundance
   and state of proteins, the major functional units in every tissue. The
   proteomic analysis of colon biopsies affected by UC gives data on these
   changes at the main site of the disease. Advances in sample
   preparation, instrumentation, and analysis software allow for
   increasing proteome coverage and improved quantification. Higher
   proteome coverage, growing and new pathway databases, and improved
   software packages benefit comprehensive enrichment analyses of tissues.

   Proteomic studies with different designs regarding samples and
   analytical method were previously conducted on colon mucosa affected by
   UC. Inflamed mucosa from untreated patients at UC debut [[38]3] as well
   as macroscopically normal mucosa from treated UC patients [[39]4] have
   been compared to biopsies from healthy controls in previous studies. A
   comparison of inflamed mucosa from untreated UC patients with mucosa
   from healthy controls as well as from Crohn’s disease patients was
   conducted on pediatric patients [[40]5]. Another study compared
   inflamed and non-inflamed tissue from the same patients [[41]6].
   Despite the differences in the study designs, the studies present
   remarkably similar proteome changes [[42]3]. They revealed novel
   insights into the UC pathophysiology, e.g. the role of neutrophil
   extracellular traps [[43]4] and S100 proteins [[44]3]. They also
   identified biomarkers for differentiating between UC and Crohn’s
   disease [[45]5] and between pancolitis and partial colitis [[46]7].
   Furthermore, multiple studies investigated specific proteins of
   interest and their functions in UC, such as inducible nitric oxide
   synthase (NOS2) [[47]8] and histaminase (AOC1) [[48]9].

   However, despite the challenges in extracting biological information
   from omics data and the shortcomings of focusing on proteins with the
   highest fold-changes [[49]10], enrichment analyses were not the main
   scope of previous proteomics studies on UC. Omics studies typically
   produce large amounts of data. Especially in experiments with strong
   phenotypes these datasets can contain so many significant findings that
   a sensible interpretation without additional statistical analyses is
   barely possible. Interpretations based on only the highest fold-changes
   in such a dataset disregard large amounts of data and fail to recognize
   functional changes as a result of multiple moderately different
   abundances. Moreover, the biological interpretation is prone to be
   arbitrary, and it has further disadvantages. Enrichment analyses can
   overcome these difficulties [[50]10] and the enrichment factors give an
   additional indication for the importance of the respective functions
   for the disease pathophysiology.

   Beside proteomics, transcriptomic approaches have been applied to
   investigate UC [[51]11]. These studies show differential mRNA
   expressions in UC tissue. The pathophysiological implications of these
   finding however are less clear because the correlation of mRNA and
   protein abundances is poor. The cause for that low correlation is that
   both the translation and the degradation of proteins are subject to
   several regulation mechanisms that are independent of mRNA levels
   [[52]12].

   We conducted a comprehensive enrichment analysis on a proteomics
   dataset of 8562 identified proteins from colon mucosa biopsies.

Materials and methods

Patients included and biopsies collection

   Mucosal biopsies were collected from newly diagnosed treatment-naïve UC
   patients in Norway. The UC diagnosis was established upon clinical,
   endoscopic and histological criteria defined by the European Crohn and
   Colitis Organization (ECCO) guidelines [[53]13]. Furthermore, the
   degree of inflammation was evaluated during colonoscopy using the
   scoring system of ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI)
   [[54]14]. Moreover, TNF mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR to
   assess the level of UC activity [[55]15]. Subjects admitted for a
   cancer screening and with normal colonoscopy and histological findings
   served as healthy controls. None of the recruited subjects suffered
   from irritable bowel disease and they were not on nonsteroidal
   anti-inflammatory drug medication prior to the colonoscopy. The
   biopsies from the UC patients were obtained from the most inflamed area
   in rectum or sigmoid colon. Biopsies from the control group were
   obtained from the rectum. From each study participant, 3 adjacent
   biopsies were obtained from the inflamed mucosa. One biopsy was
   immediately immersed in RNAlater (Qiagen, Germany). The second biopsy
   was frozen immediately in a dry cryotube tube at − 70 °C until further
   analysis. The third biopsy was obtained for ordinary histological
   examinations (haematoxylin and eosin staining). 17 patients with debut
   of UC and 15 healthy controls were recruited as shown in Table [56]1.

Baseline characteristics

   The baseline characteristics are shown in Table [61]1 (see Additional
   file [62]1: Table 1). All subjects included showed typical histological
   findings according to UC and normal, non-inflamed mucosa, respectively.

Sample preparation

   Samples were homogenized with 250 µl cooled lysis buffer [8 M urea, 5%
   sodium deoxycholate (SDC), 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer
   pH 8.5 (TEAB)] in MagNA Lyser Green Bead tubes (Roche Diagnostics AG,
   Rotkreuz, Switzerland) with a MagNA Lyser Instrument (Roche Diagnostics
   AG, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) for 35 s at 6500 rpm. Lysates were frozen at
   − 70 °C until further sample preparation. All samples and standards
   were diluted/produced to contain 5 mM TEAB for the BCA assay (Pierce™
   BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The assay was
   performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Lysate aliquots of
   60 µg protein were transferred to Protein LoBind tubes (Eppendorf AG,
   Hamburg, Germany). Disulfide bridges were reduced with
   1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) at a concentration of 5 mM by incubation at
   54 °C for 30 min. Cysteins were alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide
   (IAA) and incubation for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. DTT
   solution corresponding to a final concentration of 5 mM was added to
   remove excess IAA. Lys-C predigestion was performed under gentle
   agitation for 8 h at 37 °C with 0.6 µg Lys-C (enzyme-to-protein ratio
   1:100, w/w, Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany) in a buffer containing
   1 mM calcium chloride, 6 M urea, and 100 mM TEAB. Calcium chloride
   solution, 3 µg trypsin (enzyme-to-protein ratio 1:20, w/w, Sequencing
   Grade Modified Trypsin, Promega Corporation, Madison, USA), water, and
   1 M TEAB were added to a final concentration of 1 mM calcium chloride,
   1 M urea, and 100 mM TEAB. Tryptic digestion was performed under gentle
   agitation for 16 h at 37 °C.

   Equal peptide amounts from each sample were combined to produce a
   standard mixture, which was subsequently labelled with TMT126. Aliquots
   corresponding to 25 µg peptides were labelled with the remaining
   TMTsixplex isotopes according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 0.4 mg
   TMT reagent were used for 25 µg peptides from samples with starting
   protein concentrations ≥ 2200 µg/ml. Higher amounts of TMT reagent were
   used for lower starting concentrations (see Additional file [63]1:
   Table 2).

   The differently labelled peptides were mixed in equal amounts to in
   total 100 µg peptides. The digests were acidified with 50% formic acid
   (FA) to a final concentration of 2.5% FA and pH ≤ 2. The samples were
   centrifuged at 16,000 g for 15 min and the supernatants were carefully
   transferred to fresh tubes. Acetonitrile was removed by evaporation in
   a vacuum concentrator.

   Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to a concentration of 0.1%. The
   samples were fractionated with Pierce™ High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide
   Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher, Rockford, USA) according to the
   manufacturer’s protocol. Samples exceeding 300 µl were stepwise loaded
   with 2 min centrifugation after each loading. The fractions were dried
   in a vacuum concentrator and redissolved in 10 µl 0.1% TFA for
   subsequent LC–MS/MS analyses.

LC–MS/MS

   The nano-LC–MS/MS analysis was performed on a Q Exactive mass
   spectrometer coupled to an EASY-nLC 1000 system (Thermo Fisher
   Scientific, Bremen, Germany).

   Shortly, 2.0 µg peptides, as measured with a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo
   Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) at a wavelength of 205 nm and
   extinction coefficient 31 mg/ml [[64]16], per sample were injected.
   They were concentrated on a reversed-phase trap column and subsequently
   separated on a reversed-phase main column. A binary solvent gradient of
   0.1% FA (solvent A) and 0.1% FA in acetonitrile (solvent B) was used.
   The ACN proportion was increased from 0 to 5% over 19 min, further to
   30% at 180 min and to 100% at 200 min. A detailed description of the
   LC–MS/MS conditions can be found in the supporting information (see
   Additional file [65]1).

Data evaluation

   The raw data was analyzed with MaxQuant against a UniProt fasta file of
   all human proteins (see Additional file [66]1) [[67]17, [68]18].
   Further analyses were performed with Perseus [[69]19] and
   Cytoscape/ClueGO [[70]20, [71]21].

   The data processing and visualization in Perseus is partially based on
   a recently published protocol by the Perseus developers [[72]22]. The
   intensities were log2-transformed in Perseus, and the entries were
   filtered for the labels “potential contaminant”, “reverse” and “only
   identified by site”. Standard intensities were subtracted from the
   corresponding sample intensities and the resulting intensities Z-score
   transformed (matrix access: columns), which returns the normalized
   values (see Additional file [73]1).

Statistics and generation of figures and lists

   Statistical analyses were performed in Perseus. The samples were
   assigned to the groups UC patients and healthy controls, respectively,
   and the groups containing the separate values for each sample were
   compared to each other with a two-sample test. Proteins were annotated
   with gene ontology terms from the databases GOBP (biological process),
   GOMF (molecular function), GOCC (cellular component) [[74]23], KEGG
   [[75]24], GSEA [[76]25], UniProt keywords [[77]18], InterPro [[78]26],
   Reactome [[79]27], and PROSITE [[80]28]. The lists and the article
   figures were prepared in Perseus and the Cytoscape app ClueGO (see
   Additional file [81]1). The WikiPathways database was used for the
   ClueGO analysis [[82]29]. Pathways were mapped with HumanCyc (see
   Additional file [83]1) [[84]30].

Results and discussion

Exploratory analysis

   The proteomes of UC and healthy tissue differed strongly, as shown in
   Fig. [85]1. We present the 20 proteins with the highest abundance
   increases and decreases, respectively, in Table [86]2. The Pearson
   correlations of normalized intensities (see Additional file [87]1) were
   higher when samples of the same group were compared (i.e. UC to UC, or
   healthy control to healthy control) than when UC samples were compared
   to healthy controls (Fig. [88]1a). Also the hierarchical clustering of
   the sample correlations resulted in separate grouping of UC and healthy
   samples (Fig. [89]1a). In addition averaged profiles showed high
   Pearson correlations (> 0.7) for comparisons within the groups UC and
   healthy, respectively, and low correlations (< 0.1) for comparisons of
   UC to healthy (Fig. [90]1b). Several multi scatter plots were
   investigated with random samples from UC patients or healthy controls
   in each group, and all showed the same trend with high correlations
   internally in the UC and healthy sample groups. Upon unsupervised
   investigation by principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. [91]1c) a
   strong separation of UC and healthy in component 1 which explains 39.9%
   of the variance was observed. To investigate possible biases we
   controlled for grouping by gender, and such grouping did not occur.

Comparison with previous proteomics studies on UC

   The in total 8562 identified proteins provided the so far deepest view
   into the proteome of human colon mucosa and of UC. We report the
   abundance changes including p values for all quantified proteins (see
   Additional file [123]2: Excel file). 6818 of these proteins were
   quantified in at least 70% of the samples and were subject to
   enrichment analysis. Our data confirmed and extends previous findings,
   but also includes novel findings, such as the increased abundance of
   signal peptidase complex proteins. We searched PubMed for the terms
   “ulcerative colitis proteomics” and reviewed the titles and abstracts
   to select the relevant studies. Additionally we included studies
   previously known to the authors, totaling to 7 studies for the
   comparison [[124]3–[125]9]. The present study was largely in agreement
   with those previous studies about the direction of abundance changes of
   differently abundant proteins. However, the magnitudes of the changes
   differed.

Functional analysis

   Hierarchical clustering of the 596 most differently abundant proteins
   (8.7% of all proteins quantified in > 70% of samples; s0 = 2,
   FDR = 0.01) revealed three major clusters (Fig. [126]2). The proteins
   which were higher abundant in UC divided into two clusters, a small
   cluster of 20 proteins with a more pronounced abundance change in a
   subgroup of samples, and a large cluster of 247 proteins. The lower
   abundant proteins formed one cluster of 313 proteins. In total 16
   proteins were outside these three clusters.

   The extraction of biological information from omics datasets is a major
   challenge. Enrichment analyses can overcome some of the difficulties
   [[129]10]. Enrichment analyses annotate categorical terms (e.g.
   functions, localizations, pathways) to proteins and subsequently
   determine which terms are overrepresented among the differently
   abundant proteins compared to the entire dataset of quantified
   proteins. Knowledge about the involved pathways and functions can help
   to understand the disease, understand complications, and develop new
   treatment options.

   Abundance changes found in tissue proteomics could result from
   differential regulation of the protein abundances in cells, but also
   from changes of the cell population (e.g. from the migration of immune
   cells into inflamed tissue in UC [[130]11]) or the extracellular
   matrix. It seems plausible that each of these factors affects all
   measured abundances in such an experiment to varying degrees.

   Lists of the enriched gene ontology terms among proteins which were
   found to be differently abundant in UC as compared to healthy tissue,
   and a list of the proteins which contributed to the functions discussed
   in the following are provided as Additional file [131]2: Excel file.

   This article can neither cover all enriched terms we found, nor can it
   discuss the impact of each differently abundant protein on a function
   or the magnitude of its abundance change in detail. We therefore
   strongly encourage the reader to consult the above mentioned tables for
   further information on functions and proteins of interest.

Lower abundant in UC

   321 proteins showed decreased abundances in UC as compared to healthy
   control samples. 313 of these grouped into one cluster (Fig. [132]2,
   cluster 3). Functional analysis revealed that metabolic pathways were
   overrepresented among the proteins with decreased abundance in UC. The
   enrichment of proteins with decreased abundances in our dataset affects
   short-chain and long-chain fatty acid, ketone body and amino acid
   (particularly tryptophan) metabolism as well as the tricarboxylic acid
   (TCA) cycle (see Additional file [133]1: SuppPathway1–4) and the
   electron transport chain (ETC; Fig. [134]3a).

   The observed abundance decreases of butyrate utilizing proteins are in
   line with previous studies which show a decreased butyrate metabolism
   by UC tissue. Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and the main
   energy source of healthy colon mucosa [[137]31]. It was previously
   hypothesized that ulcerative colitis is an energy-deficiency disease
   resulting from the failure to utilize butyrate [[138]31]. Colonocytes
   convert a part of the butyrate to ketone bodies [[139]32]. Our data
   showed that proteins related to this specific utilization of butyrate
   were lower abundant in UC. Several studies have investigated whether
   butyrate has a positive effect on inflamed colon tissue, however the
   results of these studies are conflicting [[140]33].

   The decreased protein abundances also affected the transport and
   metabolism of the long-chain fatty acids (LCFA), i.e. the long carbon
   chain analogs of SCFAs. LCFAs have an ambiguous role in ulcerative
   colitis. Linoleic acid increases the chances of developing ulcerative
   colitis [[141]34]. Omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid
   (DHA), may reduce the chance of developing the disease [[142]35].
   Studies on the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of
   ulcerative colitis show controversial results. Systematic reviews
   however conclude that large high-quality studies fail to show positive
   effects, and that there is no sufficient evidence for the efficiacy of
   omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of UC [[143]36, [144]37].

   Mitochondrial enzymes involved in the metabolism of SCFA and LCFA as
   well as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and the electron transport chain
   (ETC) were found in our dataset to be low abundant in UC. These
   findings reflect a mitochondrial dysfunction which possibly contributes
   to the proposed energy deficiency [[145]38].

   Proteins related to nuclear receptors were of decreased abundance in
   UC. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-inducible
   proteins were lower abundant in UC (Fig. [146]3). The changes in the
   LCFA transport and the PPAR pathway are interdependent. Activation of
   the intracellular PPAR receptors by LCFA demands the import of the
   fatty acids into the cell and the transport within the cell. One
   protein involved in the transport into the cell is CD36 which is low
   abundant in UC tissue. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) facilitate
   the transport within the cell [[147]39]. Four FABPs (FABP1, FABP2,
   FABP4, and FABP5) are among the proteins with the lowest relative
   abundance in UC tissue compared to healthy tissue. A decreased
   transport of LCFA might in turn be partially causative for the
   decreased abundances of PPAR-inducible proteins, such as ACOX1, HMGCS2,
   FABP1, and PCK1 [[148]40]. In accordance with a previous study
   [[149]41], we found the vitamin D3 receptor NR1i1 to be lower abundant
   in UC tissue. However, we observed no general abundance changes of
   proteins regulated by this receptor. Previous studies found decreased
   abundances of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) in UC and
   suggested a role in the disease pathophysiology [[150]42]. Our data
   supports these findings.

   All detected metallothioneins—MT1H, MT2A, and MT1F—were found to be
   lower abundant in UC tissue compared to healthy controls.
   Metallothioneins are small, cysteine-rich proteins, which bind heavy
   metal cations. Our findings confirmed several previous studies, which
   concluded that the decreased metallothionein abundances may result in
   an inefficient antioxidant response in the mucosa and in turn
   contributes to the IBD pathophysiology [[151]43]. However, other
   studies present conflicting results and conclusions [[152]44].

   Histamine is the major mediator of mast cells and contributes to the
   immuno-inflammatory reaction in IBD. Previous studies showed increased
   histamine secretion and levels in UC affected tissues [[153]45] and
   decreased histaminase (AOC1) activity [[154]9]. The present study
   revealed that both major histamine degrading enzymes—Histaminase (AOC1)
   and histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT)—were lower abundant in UC
   tissue compared to healthy tissue (not based on enrichment analysis).
   This finding constitutes a plausible causative explanation for some of
   the previously reported findings on histamine in UC.

   Chemical compounds undergo phase I and phase II biotransformation
   reactions which make them more hydrophilic [[155]46]. This allows their
   excretion with urine because the polar compounds are not reabsorbed in
   the kidneys [[156]47]. Phase I reactions introduce or change functional
   groups by oxidation, reduction, or hydrolysis. In phase II reactions,
   enzymes attach hydrophilic endogenous compounds [[157]46]. Our data
   showed that the abundances of a large proportion of both phase I and
   phase II enzymes are decreased in UC. A decrease of xenobiotic
   metabolism gene products in UC was shown earlier on mRNA level
   [[158]48]. The affected phase II enzymes are involved in sulfonation,
   glucuronidation, and glutathione conjugation. Proteins related to both
   phase 1 (monoamine oxidase A, MAOA) and phase 2 metabolism
   (sulfotransferases) of catecholamines were found in our dataset to be
   less abundant in UC. This could contribute to previously found
   increases of norepinephrine in rectal UC mucosa [[159]49].

   Synthetic steroids are an important treatment option for ulcerative
   colitis. Our data showed impairments in the steroid metabolism in UC.
   This suggests a role of endogenous steroids in the pathophysiology of
   the disease. The hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases HSD11B2, HSD17B11,
   HSD17B2, and HSD17B7 were among the most down-regulated proteins in UC
   (HSD17B8 is downregulated to a lesser degree). The abundances of
   HSD17B4, HSD17B10, and HSD17B12 were not different in UC from healthy
   tissue. Decreased abundances of HSD11B2 [[160]50] and HSD17B7 [[161]3]
   have been reported previously. Our data furthermore showed that
   proteins related to the transport of bile acids are enriched among the
   lower abundant proteins, which supports findings of a previous study
   [[162]41]. Pathway mapping shows abundance decreases of proteins
   involved in the neutral pathway of bile acids biosynthesis (Additional
   file [163]1: SuppPathway5). However, the implications of this finding
   are not clear, because bile acids are primarily synthesized in
   hepatocytes, whereas there is no evidence of bile acid synthesis in
   enterocytes [[164]51].

   The carbonic anhydrases CA1, CA2, CA4, and CA12 were found to be lower
   abundant in UC. CA3 was the only quantified but not significantly lower
   abundant carbonic anhydrase. A decreased abundance in UC was reported
   earlier for CA1 [[165]52].

   Fibrillar collagens are a subgroup of collagens and provide
   three-dimensional frameworks for tissues and organs [[166]53]. The
   fibrillar collagens were enriched among the proteins that were of
   decreased abundance in UC. Proteins that are involved in collagen
   degradation, e.g. metalloproteinases, on the other hand were enriched
   among the proteins with increased abundance in UC (see below). This
   finding is in accordance with a previous study on the role of collagen
   degradation in IBD [[167]54].

Higher abundant proteins in UC

   As expected, many proteins with increased abundance in UC are involved
   in inflammatory and immune processes (Fig. [168]3b). Proteins related
   to neutrophils (e.g. NADPH oxidase complex proteins which generate
   superoxide, metalloproteinases) and B cells (e.g. V and C regions of
   immunoglobulins) were highly enriched. This could result from a tissue
   infiltration by these immune cells.

   The higher abundant proteins divided into two main clusters under
   hierarchical clustering (Fig. [169]2, clusters 1 and 2). The UC
   patients with high cluster 1 protein abundances (UC1, UC2, UC5, UC8,
   UC15, UC17) grouped together (Fig. [170]2a, b). Cluster 1 contained
   proteins occurring in neutrophils, among these Protein S100A8 and
   Protein S100A9 which together form the calprotectin complex (see
   Additional file [171]1: Table 3). Several proteins (calprotectin,
   S100A12, lactotransferrin) of the minor cluster have been used to
   differentiate between IBD and non-IBD [[172]55]. Interestingly, the
   average Geboes index in the patient cluster with high cluster 1 protein
   abundances is 11.0 (SD = 3.1), while it is 6.5 (SD = 3.2) for the other
   patients.

   Our data showed that inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) is higher
   abundant in UC tissue (not based on enrichment analysis). NOS2 produces
   nitric oxide (NO) which has various physiological roles as a messenger
   molecule. It functions most prominently as a vasodilator [[173]56], but
   it is also involved in the immune system [[174]57]. NO is directly
   toxic to pathogens, induces or suppresses apoptosis, and regulates the
   immune reaction [[175]58]. Excess NO is cytotoxic and induces cell
   death. NOS2 is inducible by inflammation, infection and other stimuli.
   Increased NOS2 abundances in UC were shown earlier by immunostaining
   [[176]8] and our results confirm these findings.

   Proteins with functions in protein processing in the endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER) are overrepresented among the proteins which were more
   abundant in UC. Also unfolded protein response (UPR) and signal
   peptidase complex (SPC) proteins are related to protein processing,
   located in the ER, and enriched among proteins with increased
   abundances in UC. UPR has previously been identified as one factor in
   the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis [[177]59]. The enrichment of
   SPC proteins among proteins with increased abundances in UC is a novel
   finding from our data.

   However, ER proteins were not generally higher abundant. For instance,
   many metabolic enzymes are located in the ER and enriched among the
   proteins with decreased abundances (e.g. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases,
   see “[178]Lower abundant in UC” section).

   The SPC is not inherently inflammatory. Nonetheless its proteins were
   among those with the highest abundance increases in UC. The SPC is
   located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and cleaves the
   signal peptide cotranslationally from nascent proteins [[179]60]. The
   SPC subunits SPCS1, SPCS2, and SPCS3 and the SPC catalytic subunit
   SEC11C were more abundant in UC. They furthermore showed highly similar
   abundance profiles (Additional file [180]1: Figure 3). The SPC
   catalytic subunit SEC11 however does not follow this pattern and was
   similarly abundant in UC and healthy tissue.

   Accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins causes stress to the
   endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR aims to remove these proteins. To
   achieve this, the cell stops the translation of further proteins,
   degrades misfolded proteins, and produces chaperones, which correct the
   protein folding. Our data showed strong enrichment of proteins related
   to UPR, response to ER stress, and the ER chaperone complex among the
   higher abundant proteins in UC. Specifically, several chaperones that
   can be induced by ATF6 alpha (HSP90B1, calreticulin [[181]61], and
   HSPA5 [[182]62]), which plays a central role in UPR, were enriched. Our
   findings support previous assumptions that the UPR may play a role in
   the pathophysiology of UC.

Foreseeable applications

   The functional changes we observed in the present study allow for
   hypothesis generation for treatment approaches.

   Alterations of metabolic pathways in ulcerative colitis imply that
   nutritional interventions directed at the respective metabolites could
   be effective in the treatment of the disease. For instance, decreased
   metallothionein abundances indicate that the detoxification of heavy
   metals and the utilization of polyvalent metal ions could be impaired.
   Considering the decreased detoxification capacities, reduced intake or
   chelation of toxic heavy metals might have beneficial effects. On the
   other hand, the supplementation of essential polyvalent metal ions
   could be advantageous. Furthermore, the decreased metabolic and
   transport capabilities related to butyrate contribute probably to the
   energy deprivation of colonocytes. Previous studies investigated the
   treatment of UC with butyrate and other SCFA. But the
   pathophysiological changes we observed related to the utilization of
   those compounds imply that supplementation with a later metabolite such
   as beta-hydroxybutyrate might be preferable. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is a
   ketone body that becomes systemically available after oral
   administration and has been used in the treatment of other
   pathophysiological conditions [[183]63, [184]64].

   The enrichment of proteins related to signaling pathways such as PPAR
   designates the respective pathways as potential drug targets.

   Abundance changes of single proteins may have similar implications,
   especially if they are known to be drugable. Proteins with high
   abundance differences between UC patients and healthy controls and high
   corresponding − Log p values are of potential interest as biomarker
   candidates. Proteins with these characteristics are for instance
   SLC26A2, HMGCS2, and CD38 (Additional file [185]1: Figure 4; Additional
   file [186]2).

   However, further testing, clinical studies, and validation will be
   necessary before any clinical application.

Conclusions

   Our study presents new evidence and complements previous findings about
   changes of biological functions in UC. The major novel findings of this
   study were the increased abundances of SPC proteins and the presence of
   two distinguished clusters of higher abundant proteins, with the
   calprotectin complex proteins S100A8 and S100A9 in the minor cluster 1.
   This cluster of 20 proteins diverged from the abundance changes of the
   majority of proteins with increased abundances in UC that we observed
   in cluster 2.

   In conclusion, abundances in UC tissue were increased compared to
   healthy controls for proteins related to the immune system and to
   protein processing in the ER, e.g. UPR and SPC proteins. Immune cell
   infiltration into the inflamed tissue contributes probably to the
   increased immune system protein abundances. The high abundance of UPR
   proteins indicates an ER stress response. Moreover, NOS2 which produces
   NO was higher abundant in UC tissue.

   Lower abundant in UC were predominantly metabolic proteins. These
   metabolic proteins comprise mitochondrial enzymes for the
   metabolization of SCFA and LCFA as well as proteins of the TCA cycle
   and the ETC. These changes are probably contributing to the previously
   reported mitochondrial dysfunction and energy deficiency of colonocytes
   in UC. The abundances of LCFA transport proteins were decreased which
   may be partially causative for the decreased abundances of
   PPAR-inducible proteins. Decreased abundances of histamine degrading
   enzymes probably contribute to the increased histamine levels in UC
   tissue which were found in previous studies. Furthermore, abundances of
   proteins involved in phase I and phase II biotransformation were
   decreased, as well as the abundances of several metallothioneins,
   hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, and carbonic anhydrases.

   changes UC/H and p values as supporting information (see Additional
