Here are the answers to the questions:

1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?
The article does not specifically mention a tool used for pathway enrichment analysis, but it mentions that "bioinformatics results" and "PPI analysis" were conducted, suggesting that a bioinformatics platform or software was used.

2. Was a tool version number provided?
Not described.

3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?
The article mentions that the "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway" and "glucagon signaling pathway" were identified, suggesting that the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database was queried.

4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described.

5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?
Not described.

6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described.
