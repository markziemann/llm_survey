Here are the answers to the questions:

1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?
The tools used for pathway enrichment analysis were DAVID server and a tissue restricted gene enrichment approach (using Gene Ontology).

2. Was a tool version number provided?
Yes, the version number of the DAVID server was provided as 6.8.

3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?
The gene set libraries queried were Gene Ontology (GO) and possibly others through the DAVID server, but only GO is explicitly mentioned.

4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?
Yes, a background gene list was defined for pathway enrichment analysis, which consisted of 10,919 genes reported as expressed in bovine skeletal muscle by the EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas.

5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?
Not described, but it is mentioned that the significance of each enriched term was adjusted applying the Benjamini-Hochberg p-value correction, which implies a statistical test was used, but the specific test is not mentioned.

6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?
Yes, the Benjamini-Hochberg p-value correction was used, which is a method for controlling the false discovery rate.
