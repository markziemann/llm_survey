Here are the answers to the questions about pathway enrichment analysis:

1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?
The tool used for pathway enrichment analysis is Blast all software against the KEGG database, and also OmicShare tools.

2. Was a tool version number provided?
No, the tool version number was not provided.

3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?
The KEGG database was queried for pathway enrichment analysis.

4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described.

5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?
Not described, but it is mentioned that KEGG pathways with a Q-value ≤0.05 are significantly enriched in DEGs.

6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?
Yes, it is mentioned that the Q-value (which is a measure of false discovery rate) was used to determine significant enrichment, with a threshold of Q-value ≤0.05.
