Abstract

Background

   Glucose is the main secretagogue of pancreatic beta-cells. Uptake and
   metabolism of the nutrient stimulates the beta-cell to release the
   blood glucose lowering hormone insulin. This metabolic activation is
   associated with a pronounced increase in mitochondrial respiration.
   Glucose stimulation also initiates a number of signal transduction
   pathways for the coordinated regulation of multiple biological
   processes required for insulin secretion.

Methods

   Shotgun proteomics including TiO[2] enrichment of phosphorylated
   peptides followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry on
   lysates from glucose-stimulated INS-1E cells was used to identify
   glucose regulated phosphorylated proteins and signal transduction
   pathways. Kinase substrate enrichment analysis (KSEA) was applied to
   identify key regulated kinases and phosphatases. Glucose-induced oxygen
   consumption was measured using a XF96 Seahorse instrument to reveal
   cross talk between glucose-regulated kinases and mitochondrial
   activation.

Results

   Our kinetic analysis of substrate phosphorylation reveal the molecular
   mechanism leading to rapid activation of insulin biogenesis, vesicle
   trafficking, insulin granule exocytosis and cytoskeleton remodeling.
   Kinase-substrate enrichment identified upstream kinases and
   phosphatases and time-dependent activity changes during glucose
   stimulation. Activity trajectories of well-known glucose-regulated
   kinases and phosphatases are described. In addition, we predict
   activity changes in a number of kinases including NUAK1, not or only
   poorly studied in the context of the pancreatic beta-cell. Furthermore,
   we pharmacologically tested whether signaling pathways predicted by
   kinase-substrate enrichment analysis affected glucose-dependent
   acceleration of mitochondrial respiration. We find that
   phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase and
   protein kinase C contribute to short-term regulation of energy
   metabolism.

Conclusions

   Our results provide a global view into the regulation of kinases and
   phosphatases in insulin secreting cells and suggest cross talk between
   glucose-induced signal transduction and mitochondrial activation.

Background

   Pancreatic beta-cells secrete the blood glucose lowering hormone
   insulin. Following a meal, glucose rises in the blood and acts as the
   primary secretagogue for insulin secretion [[38]1]. Insulin secretion
   is biphasic. The first phase lasts several minutes and is mainly due to
   the exocytosis of a readily releasable pool of insulin granules
   [[39]2]. During the second phase, insulin secretion increases
   gradually. This can take up to several hours when glucose remains
   elevated [[40]3]. Therefore, during continued glucose stimulation
   beta-cells are able to adjust insulin biosynthesis and release to
   restore glucose homeostasis.

   The beta-cell senses glucose through its uptake and metabolism rather
   than via a plasma membrane glucose receptor. Initial beta-cell
   activation is rapid as it takes less than 2 min for glucose to raise
   cytosolic calcium signals that trigger insulin granule exocytosis
   [[41]4, [42]5]. The link between glucose metabolism and insulin
   secretion has been termed metabolism-secretion coupling. Mitochondria
   are essential for this process as they generate metabolic signals,
   including ATP, that control beta-cell electrical activity and
   associated calcium signals resulting in insulin exocytosis [[43]6,
   [44]7]. Mitochondrial activation by glucose is a two-step process.
   First, glucose provides pyruvate, which rapidly accelerates
   mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and ATP synthesis [[45]4, [46]8].
   This early activation (< 2 min) initiates cytosolic and mitochondrial
   calcium signaling, which further accelerates respiration and
   mitochondrial ATP synthesis [[47]9–[48]11]. This slow calcium dependent
   rise in oxygen consumption lasts longer (> 30 min) and is required to
   assure sustained beta-cell activation [[49]10, [50]12].

   The transition from a resting to an activated beta-cell is not
   restricted to accelerated metabolism and insulin secretion. Several
   other biological processes undergo pronounced glucose-induced changes.
   For example, stimulatory glucose concentrations cause a general
   increase in protein biosynthesis through the activation of translation
   initiation [[51]13, [52]14]. This is particularly true for
   preproinsulin where glucose stimulation stabilizes the mRNA and
   specifically activates translation of preproinsulin and other
   components of secretory granules (reviewed in [[53]15]). Furthermore,
   glucose stimulates microtubule dynamics [[54]16] and induces
   polymerization of the subplasmamembrane actin cytoskeleton [[55]17]. By
   controlling cytoskeleton dynamics, glucose is able to promote the
   transfer of insulin granules from a reserve to a readily releasable
   pool.

   Glucose primarily stimulates beta-cells through the activation of
   energy metabolism, required for the initiation of calcium signaling. As
   a secondary consequence, a surprising large number of signal
   transduction mechanisms are modulated during glucose stimulation. Such
   intracellular signaling is necessary to control the coordinated and
   time-dependent regulation of the above-mentioned biological processes.
   A main regulatory mechanism is reversible phosphorylation. In the
   beta-cell, several kinases and phosphatases have been demonstrated to
   influence glucose stimulated insulin secretion [[56]18–[57]20]. Key
   regulators include protein kinase A (PKA; [[58]21]), protein kinase C
   (PKC; [[59]22]), the insulin receptor and down-stream signaling kinases
   (reviewed in [[60]23]), AMP activated protein kinase [[61]24], CaMKII
   [[62]25] and calcineurin [[63]26] among others. Signaling via these
   kinases and phosphatases may also directly contribute to the regulation
   of metabolism-secretion coupling for instance at the level of
   mitochondria. In support of this hypothesis, a proteomic study has
   identified a number of mitochondrial phosphoproteins in insulin
   secreting cells [[64]27]. Kinase-substrate relationship analysis
   revealed enrichment in PKC substrates. The data suggests kinases of the
   PKC family are upstream regulators of mitochondrial function.
   Consistent with these findings, we recently demonstrated that
   short-term regulation of PKC rapidly modulates glucose-stimulated
   mitochondrial respiration [[65]28]. For a number of other signal
   transduction pathways, their role in glucose-induced respiration has
   not been investigated to date.

   Several proteomic studies have identified phosphoproteins regulated
   during glucose-mediated beta-cell activation [[66]29–[67]33]. These
   studies have restricted themselves either to the study of a single
   time-point or have followed phosphorylation dynamics at very early
   stages of glucose-induced beta-cell activation. However, in response to
   a meal, glucose remains elevated for extended periods of time [[68]1].
   Here we have therefore compared regulation of protein phosphorylation
   from short-term (5 min) to later stages (30 and 60 min) of glucose
   stimulation. By analyzing dynamic changes of protein phosphorylation up
   to an hour, we may be able to gain insight into different phases of
   beta-cell activation during a meal. Furthermore, a main aim of this
   work was to determine whether there is a link between kinase-mediated
   signal transduction and mitochondrial activation beyond mitochondrial
   calcium signaling. Although the initial respiratory response is rapid,
   full activation of mitochondria by glucose requires up to one hour.
   Analyzing the dynamic changes in protein phosphorylation over this
   time-course may give us new insight into beta-cells signal transduction
   in relation to mitochondrial activation.

   The here identified phosphoproteins were assigned to different
   biological processes regulated by glucose. Time-dependent
   phosphorylation of effector proteins gave us insight into kinetics of
   glucose-induced signaling and the coordinated regulation of protein
   translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements, ion homeostasis, insulin
   biogenesis, vesicle trafficking and insulin granule exocytosis. In
   addition, we used Kinase Substrate Enrichment Analysis (KSEA) to
   identify kinases and phosphatases responsible for the observed
   glucose-induced global phosphorylation changes. Respiratory analysis of
   glucose-stimulated insulin secreting cells (INS1) combined with
   pharmacological modulation of the KSEA regulated kinases demonstrated
   that a number of glucose regulated kinases impact on energy metabolism.

Methods

Reagents

   Chemicals were from Sigma (Switzerland), Invitrogen (Switzerland), VWR
   (Switzerland) or Tocris (Switzerland) unless otherwise indicated.

INS-1E cell culture

   INS-1E cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2)
   in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 11 mM glucose, supplemented
   with 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum
   (FCS; Brunschwig AG, Switzerland), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 μM
   β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin
   (Sigma, Switzerland).

Mitochondrial respiration measurements

   Oxygen consumption was measured using a XF96 instrument (Seahorse
   Biosciences, MA, USA). INS-1E cells were seeded into Seahorse tissue
   culture plates (Seahorse XF96 V3 PS Cell Culture Microplates
   #101085–004) at a density of 40,000 cells per well. 48 h later cells
   were washed twice and incubated in basal Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES
   (KRBH) buffer containing 2.5 mM glucose, 140 mM NaCl, 3.6 mM KCl,
   0.5 mM NaH2PO4, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, and 5 mM
   NaHCO3 (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C inside the Seahorse instrument.
   Respiration rates were determined every 6 min at 37 °C using the
   following protocol 3 min of mixing were followed by 3 min of oxygen
   consumption measurements.

Western-blots

   Whole cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in RIPA buffer supplemented
   with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Switzerland), phosSTOP
   phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Switzerland), 10 mM NaF, 0.1 μM
   PMSF and 2 mM Na-orthovanadate (Sigma, Switzerland) for complete
   phosphatase inhibition. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000×g for
   20 min at 4 °C, and the protein content of the supernatant was
   determined using the Pierce® BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher,
   Switzerland). An amount of 25 μg of total protein was loaded on
   SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred
   onto nitrocellulose membrane with i-blot (Invitrogene, Switzerland) and
   probed with the following antibodies: anti-pMARCKS-Ser167/170 (Cell
   Signaling #8722) anti-MARCKS (Cell Signalling #7756), anti-ERK (Cell
   Signalling #9102), anti-pERK-Thr202/Tyr204 (Cell Signalling #MA3–919),
   anti-tubulin (Chemicon #05–829), anti-pAMPK-Thr172 (Cell Signalling
   #2535), anti-AMPK (Cell Signalling #5831), anti-pACC-Ser79 (Cell
   Signalling #3661), anti-ACC (Cell Signalling #11818), anti-pAKT-Thr308
   (Cell Signalling #2965), anti-AKT (Cell Signalling #9272),
   anti-pCREBS-Ser133 (Cell Signalling #9198), anti-CREBS (Cell Signalling
   #9197). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were
   used followed by chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences,
   Switzerland).

Phosphoproteomics and sample preparation

   60 mm diameter petri dishes where seeded with 2 × 10^6 INS-1E cells,
   and maintained in the incubator for 48 h until they reached 70–80%
   confluence. The day of the experiment, INS-1E cells were equilibrated
   at 37 °C in KRBH containing 2.5 mM glucose for 30 min. The plates were
   divided in two experimental groups and incubated either with 16.7 mM
   (high glucose) or maintained in 2.5 mM glucose in the same KRBH (low
   glucose). Subsequently, cell lysis was carried out after 5, 30 and
   60 min on both groups. Lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer containing
   broad spectrum kinase and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) at 4 °C.
   Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce® BCA Protein
   Assay Kit. Following randomization of the samples and conditions
   (Additional file [69]1: Figure S1), samples containing 150 μg of
   proteins were taken for proteomic analysis and prepared in a final
   volume of 150 μl in 100 mM triethylammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer
   pH 8.5. Protein disulfide bridges were reduced with 10 mM
   tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride for 1 h at 55 °C.
   Alkylation was performed with 17 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room
   temperature in the dark. To remove lipids and salts, proteins were
   precipitated using methanol/chloroform. Methanol (400 μl), chloroform
   (100 μl) and H[2]O (300 μl) were added sequentially. Mixtures were
   centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (~ 18,500×g) for 5 min at 4 °C. Upper and
   lower phases were discarded. The white precipitates were washed with
   methanol (300 μl) and dried for 5 min. Protein pellets were suspended
   in 150 μl of 100 mM triethylammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer pH 8.5
   and digested with an enzyme cocktail of trypsin/LysC (Promega, WI, USA)
   (1:50 w/w) at 37 °C overnight. The resulting peptides were isobarically
   labelled with tandem mass tags (TMT10plex™ from Thermo Scientific, IL,
   USA) by addition of 1.6 mg of TMT reagent in 82 μl of CH[3]CN for 1 h.
   The differentially labelled samples were pooled after reaction
   quenching with hydroxylamine. Samples were cleaned up using Oasis HLB
   cartridges (Waters, MA, USA), conditioning buffer
   (H[2]O/CH[3]CN/trifluoroacetic acid - TFA 5/94.9/0.1), loading/washing
   buffer (H[2]O/CH[3]CN/TFA 94.9/5/0.1) and elution buffer
   (H[2]O/CH[3]CN/TFA 49.9/50/0.1) as previously described^doi:
   10.1007/978-1-4939-7057-5 and finally dried (an amount of ~ 500 μg
   (non-enriched fractions) for each TMT experiment (Additional file
   [70]1: Figure S1) was kept for reversed-phase liquid chromatography
   tandem mass spectrometry (RP-LC MS/MS) analysis). From 500 μg samples,
   isobarically-10plex phosphorylated peptides were enriched with TiO[2]
   Mag Sepharose magnetic beads (GE Healthcare, Switzerland) following
   manufacturer instructions for enrichment of phosphopeptides
   (phospho-enriched fractions).

   Samples (phospho-enriched and non-enriched fractions) were dissolved in
   H[2]O/CH[3]CN/formic acid 96.9/3/0.1. RP-LC MS/MS was performed on a
   hybrid linear ion trap-Orbitrap (LTQ-OT) Elite equipped with an
   Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano system (Thermo Scientific). Proteolytic
   peptides were trapped on an Acclaim PepMap 75 μm × 2 cm (C18, 3 μm,
   100 Å) pre-column and separated on an Acclaim PepMap RSLC 75 μm × 50 cm
   (C18, 2 μm, 100 Å) column (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a stainless
   steel nanobore emitter (40 mm, OD 1/32″) mounted on a Nanospray Flex
   Ion Source (Thermo Scientific). The analytical separation of the
   phospho-enriched fractions was run for 150 min using a gradient that
   reached 30% of CH[3]CN after 140 min and 80% of CH[3]CN after 150 min
   at a flow rate of 220 nl/min. The analytical separation of the
   non-enriched fractions was run for 330 min using a gradient that
   reached 30% of CH[3]CN after 320 min and 80% of CH[3]CN after 330 min
   at a flow rate of 220 nl/min. For MS survey scans, the OT resolution
   was 120,000 at m/z = 400 (ion population of 1 × 10^6) with an m/z
   window from 300 to 1500. For MS/MS with higher-energy collisional
   dissociation at 35% of the normalized collision energy and detection in
   the OT, ion population was set to 1 × 10^5 (isolation width of 2 m/z),
   with resolution of 30,000 at m/z = 400, first mass at m/z = 100, and a
   maximum injection time of 250 ms. A maximum of 10 precursor ions (most
   intense) were selected for MS/MS. Dynamic exclusion was set for 60 s
   within a ± 5 ppm window. A lock mass of m/z = 445.1200 was used. Each
   sample was analyzed in triplicate.

   Protein identification was performed using Mascot 2.4.0 (Matrix
   Sciences, UK) against the UniProtKB rat proteome database (27/08/2014
   release; 28,900 entries). Trypsin was selected as the proteolytic
   enzyme, with a maximum of 2 potential missed cleavages. Peptide and
   fragment ion tolerance were set to, respectively, 10 ppm and 0.02 Da.
   Mascot result files from both phospho-enriched and non-enriched
   fractions were loaded into Scaffold Q + S 4.3.2 (Proteome Software, OR,
   USA) for sample normalization purposes and further searched with X!
   Tandem (The GPM, [71]thegpm.org; version CYCLONE (2010.12.01.1)). For
   the phospho-enriched fractions, we considered carbamidomethylation of
   Cys, TMT-labeling of Lys and TMT-labeling of peptide amino termini as
   fixed amino acid modifications, and oxidation of Met, deamidation of
   Asn and Gln, and phosphorylation of Ser, Thr and Tyr as variable
   modifications. For the non-enriched fractions, we considered
   carbamidomethylation of Cys as fixed amino acid modifications, and
   oxidation of Met, deamidation of Asn and Gln, acetylation of Lys,
   TMT-labeling of Lys and peptide amino termini, and phosphorylation of
   Ser, Thr and Tyr as variable modifications. Based on a target-decoy
   strategy, both peptide and protein false discovery rates were fixed at
   1% maximum, with a one-unique-peptide criterion to report protein
   identification. Scaffold PTM 3.0.0 (Proteome Software) was used to
   annotate post-translational modifications (PTMs) from Scaffold results.
   Using the site localization algorithm developed by Beausoleil et al.,
   doi:10.1038/nbt1240 Scaffold PTM re-analyzes tandem mass spectra
   identified as modified peptides and calculates Ascore values and site
   localization probabilities to assess the level of confidence in each
   PTM localization. Scaffold PTM then combines localization probabilities
   for all peptides containing each identified PTM site to obtain the
   best-estimated probability that a PTM is present at that particular
   site. Minimum localization probability was set to 95%. Isobaric tagging
   quantitative values for phosphorylated peptides were exported from
   Scaffold PTM and relative quantification of phosphorylation sites was
   computed using an in-house script with R version 3.1.1
   ([72]http://www.r-project.org/).

   Paired t-test was applied to identify proteins and p-sites displaying
   p-values≤0.05 between the low glucose and high glucose groups at every
   time point. Regulation threshold was fixed at 23%, i.e., Log2 fold
   change (FC) > 0.3 or < − 0.3.

Gene ontology enrichment, heatmap generation and identification of trajectory
clusters

   Significantly regulated phosphoproteins were assigned to gene ontology
   (GO) categories for cellular processes and cellular localization using
   Metacore (GeneGo, MI, USA). The p-values for networks and processes
   were all calculated using the same basic formula for hypergeometric
   distribution. The p-value essentially represents the probability for a
   particular mapping of an experiment to network or process to arise by
   chance, considering the numbers of genes observed in the experiment
   versus the number of genes in the network or process within the “full
   set” of genes in these networks or processes. The statistical
   programming language R and its packages ggplot, cluster and
   RColorBrewer were used to plot the heatmaps. For the ordering of the
   variables on the heatmaps, hierarchical clustering was performed on the
   phosphorylation sites using the following parameters: complete linkage
   and Gower as the metric used for obtaining the pairwise dissimilarity.
   The function ‘daisy’ from the R package ‘cluster’ was used to obtain
   the distances between variables. Gower’s distance, which allows missing
   values, computes distances between 2 data points as the sum of all the
   variable-specific distances. When all the variables are quantitative,
   like the phosphorylation sites analyzed, the distance is obtained using
   the more standard Manhattan metric. The code to draw the heatmaps was
   an adaptation from the original ggpheatmap function written by Chris
   Wallace (University of Cambridge, UK).

   The traj R package for clustering longitudinal trajectories was used to
   identify the clusters of proteins (using 1-norm distances [[73]34],
   k = 4 and discarding the 19th measure, i.e., the mean of the second
   differences). The hierarchical ordering of the GO enrichment heatmaps
   was obtained using the R hclust routine.

Kinase substrate enrichment analysis (KSEA)

   KSEA was performed as described in by Casado et al. [[74]35].
   PhosphositePlus and Signor Databases ([75]https://signor.uniroma2.it/)
   were used as the kinase-substrate relationship dataset resource.
   Essentially, phosphosites identified at 5, 30 and 60 min upon glucose
   stimulation were arranged into substrate groups defined as containing
   phosphorylation sites known to be substrates of specific kinases across
   kinase-substrate relation databases or as sharing specific
   phosphorylation motifs. Then, we calculated the extent and statistical
   significance of the enrichment of these substrate groups relative to
   the particular phosphoproteomic data set.

Results

Time-dependent protein phosphorylation during glucose stimulation of INS-1E
cells

   Nutrient activation of pancreatic beta-cells occurs in several
   time-dependent steps. At the level of mitochondrial respiration, the
   process has been dissected in an early calcium independent (first few
   minutes) and a second long lasting activation (> 30 min) (Fig. [76]1a;
   [[77]11]). As these metabolic changes occur, glucose stimulation also
   initiates a number of signal transduction pathways, which are important
   for the regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells
   [[78]19]. Here we have analyzed the kinetic changes of protein
   phosphorylation during glucose stimulation of INS-1E cells in order to
   improve our understanding of glucose-induced signal transduction and
   its possible link to mitochondrial activation. We followed protein
   phosphorylation over time, using MS-based phosphoproteomics. INS-1E
   cells were stimulated with glucose (16.7 mM) for 5, 30 and 60 min (Fig.
   [79]1b) corresponding to different phases of the beta-cell respiratory
   response (Fig. [80]1a). For each time-point, control cells maintained
   under resting glucose conditions (2.5 mM glucose) were also extracted
   (Fig. [81]1b). A proteomic workflow for the digestion, enrichment,
   identification and quantification of phosphopeptides from INS-1E
   protein lysates was used (Fig. [82]1c). This experimental design allows
   the identification of glucose-dependent changes over time excluding
   confounding phosphorylation events not primarily dependent on glucose
   activation, such as phosphorylation changes occurring during incubation
   in KRBH medium. Protein lysates from each of the three high glucose and
   matching control conditions were prepared in five independent
   experiments and the derived phosphopeptides quantified with MS. This
   strategy led to the identification of 3085 unique phosphorylation sites
   (p-sites) present in 1558 proteins (≥ 99% certainty of p-site
   localization; Fig. [83]2a). The distribution of p-sites per proteins is
   shown in Additional file [84]2: Figure S2. Only peptides present in all
   experimental conditions and at least two out of five replicates per
   condition were included in the quantitative analysis. After 5, 30 and
   60 min of glucose stimulation the phosphorylation status of 83, 116,
   and 160 p-sites were respectively altered when compared to INS-1E cells
   maintained in resting glucose (2.5 mM) (Fig. [85]2a and
   Additional file [86]3: Table S1, Additional file [87]4: Table S2 and
   Additional file [88]5: Table S3). The data for the three different time
   points were expressed as volcano plots comparing fold-changes of
   glucose-induced phosphorylation versus the statistical significance of
   the glucose-induced changes (Fig. [89]2b).

   Given the period of stimulation, synthesis or degradation of proteins
   cannot be excluded [[94]36]. To asses this possibility, we also
   interrogate our samples at the proteome level (Additional file [95]6:
   Figure S3A). The study revealed that only a small fraction of the
   p-sites regulated proteins also undergo significant changes at the
   total protein level following glucose stimulation, 13% (10/76), 21%
   (21/100) and 15% (22/145) respectively at 5, 30 and 60 min (Fig.
   [96]2a, Additional file [97]6: Figure S3B and Additional file [98]7:
   Table S4). Moreover, when common, the extent of the regulation at the
   protein level was often significantly lower, as visualized by the
   vertical spread of the points in the p-site versus protein regulation
   correlation plots (Additional file [99]6: Figure S3C).

   Phosphorylation patterns at first sight seem similar between the
   different time-points with about equal number of p-sites with increased
   and decreased phosphorylation status. However, the total number of
   p-sites increased over time (Fig. [100]2a). When looking at the p-sites
   regulated by phosphorylation, only a small fraction was significantly
   changed over the entire time-course of glucose stimulation compared to
   control. The Venn diagram (Fig. [101]2d) shows the distribution of
   significantly regulated p-sites at the different time points and the
   number of changes shared between two or threesampling conditions. Among
   the p-sites significantly changed following 5 min of glucose
   stimulation 41% (from 83 p-sites) were exclusively regulated at this
   early time-point. When comparing 30 and 60 min of glucose stimulation,
   the overlap of significantly glucose regulated phosphorylation events
   was larger but still small. Overall, only 33 p-sites (14.1% of the
   total regulated p-sites) were changed by glucose at all the time points
   following initiation of the nutrient response (Fig. [102]2d). These
   findings emphasize the importance to look into the temporal aspects of
   glucose-dependent signal transduction in insulin secreting cells.

   GO localization enrichment analysis revealed that the majority of
   p-sites undergoing significant glucose-induced changes were found in
   cytoplasmic, nuclear, plasma membrane, cytoskeletal and Golgi proteins
   (Fig. [103]2c and Additional file [104]8: Table S5). In other
   compartments, few or no p-sites were regulated by glucose. We also
   calculate enrichment of proteins involved in cellular processes
   described in the literature for having an important role in short-term
   regulation of nutrient-induced insulin secretion (Fig. [105]2c and
   Additional file [106]9: Table S6). In our data set, p-sites
   significantly regulated by glucose were enriched in cytoskeletal
   proteins, regulators of the cytoskeleton, cell-cell junction
   organization and proteins involved in vesicle-mediated transport as
   well as exocytosis (Fig. [107]2c). Phosphorylation of proteins
   reflecting these processes were altered with time following glucose
   stimulation.

   Time point-specific regulated p-sites (5 min: 34, 30 min: 29, and
   60 min: 79; Fig. [108]2d) may reveal further differences on cell
   functions/pathways differentially regulated at the phosphorylation
   level over time. To identify differentially affected GO categories
   between groups, the standard deviation of the –Log10 (p-value) amongst
   the three groups was calculated for every GO term and then the whole
   ontology was sorted in decrease order of standard deviation
   (Additional file [109]10: Table S7). Additional file [110]11: Figure S4
   displays the top 30 GO terms of such list. These results revealed that
   a number of phospho-proteins exclusively regulated at 5 min are
   responsible of nuclear mRNA processing and chromatin disassembly. On
   the other hand, a number of phospho-proteins only regulated at 60 min
   were involved in the regulation of actin organization dynamics as well
   as mRNA processing.

Identification of p-site clusters with similar phosphorylation kinetics

   Our GO cell process enrichment (Fig. [111]2c and Additional file
   [112]8: Table S5) points to the regulation of multiple cellular
   processes, linked to different degrees with glucose-dependent beta-cell
   activation. In order to capture phosphorylation kinetics across our
   full dataset, we clustered phosphorylation events that displayed
   similar changes over time. A 3-step procedure to identify clustering of
   longitudinal trajectories was applied [[113]34] (see also Materials and
   Methods). This method calculates different measures, which describe
   trajectories’ features, selects the most informative measures by
   performing a factor analysis, and clusters the data points based on
   these selected factors. This method has been used successfully to
   cluster longitudinal trajectories during disease progression [[114]34,
   [115]37].

   Based on this analysis, we separated the 102 most markedly changed
   p-sites into four distinctive clusters (Fig. [116]3a). The first two
   clusters contain phosphorylation events rapidly changing in response to
   nutrient stimulation (within 5 min; Fig. [117]3a, b). P-sites
   reflecting such rapid changes in phosphorylation status can be further
   subdivided in long-lasting changes in phosphorylation (42 p-sites,
   cluster 1) and early transient phosphorylation (12 p-sites, cluster 2).
   The other two clusters comprise p-sites whose phosphorylation status
   changes after 30 min (Fig. [118]3a, b; intermediate; 36 p-sites,
   cluster 3) or only after 60 min (Fig. [119]3a, b; late; 12 p-sites,
   cluster 4). The results highlighted the generally fast activation of
   signal transduction in response to glucose.

   Systematic identification and clustering of glucose-dependent dynamic
   phosphorylation profiles. a Analysis of p-site trajectories identified
   four main clusters according to its phosphorylation dynamics overtime:
   early (short-term), early (long-lasting), intermediate and late
   regulated. The p-site dataset included in the analysis of trajectories
   was formed by the 234 p-sites matching the p-value < 0.05 and FC
   (Log2) > 0.3 or < − 0.3 criteria in Fig. [122]2d. b P-site status
   distribution on the four clusters identified. c Heat-map showing
   distribution of glucose phospho-regulated cell processes across
   different clusters

   Clustering of time-resolved p-site trajectories can uncover
   functionally linked proteins and cellular process [[123]38]. To this
   end, members of the different clusters were assigned to GO and
   displayed in an unsupervised heatmap (Fig. [124]3c and
   Additional file [125]12: Table S8). The results show an early
   coordinated phospho-regulation of elements linked to signal
   transduction, cytoskeleton organization, gene expression, mRNA
   processing and stability, vesicle trafficking, vesicle-mediated
   exocytosis and cell-cell adhesion. Phosphorylation of proteins
   associated with energy homeostasis, carbohydrate metabolism and calcium
   ion transport was delayed (Fig. [126]3c).

Phosphorylation of proteins involved in biological processes directly linked
to beta-cell activation

   Glucose-dependent insulin secretion engages a large number of
   biological processes directly involved in the full activation of
   beta-cells. Proteins whose phosphorylation status was strongly
   regulated (p-value< 0.05 andFC (Log2) > 0.3 or < − 0.3) over the
   time-course were assigned to such biological processes including
   insulin granule exocytosis and membrane recycling (Fig. [127]4a),
   calcium signaling and pH homeostasis (Fig. [128]4b), vesicle biogenesis
   and trafficking (Fig. [129]4c), actin and tubulin cytoskeleton dynamics
   (Fig. [130]4d), protein synthesis (Fig. [131]4e) and metabolism (Fig.
   [132]4f).

   or < − 0.3 regulation during at least some of the three time points
   studied (5, 30 and 60 min) and p-value ≤0.05

   Consistent with the rapid activation of exocytosis, calcium signaling,
   cytoskeleton dynamics and vesicle trafficking, most proteins in these
   categories were significantly regulated already after 5 min, the
   shortest time-point assessed after initiation of the glucose stimulus
   (Fig. [135]4g). Both rapid (5 min) and delayed regulation (30 min) was
   measured for proteins controlling protein translation. The few
   phosphorylated metabolic enzymes were mostly regulated at the later two
   time-points (30 and 60 min; Fig. [136]4g).

   While it is impossible to describe all the phosphoproteins regulated
   during short-term glucose stimulation, we highlight a few of them in
   each functional group. Rapid phospho-regulation was noted in several
   proteins mediating and controlling the final steps of insulin granule
   transport and exocytosis (Myo5a, Sytl4, RapGap2, Rab37 and Syn1).
   Synaptotagmin-like protein 4/Granuphilin (Sytl4) is particularly
   interesting, given its well-described role in insulin granule
   exocytosis through its interaction with the Rab3 GTPase and the
   exocytosis regulator Munc-18/Sec1 [[137]39]. Several proteins in Fig.
   [138]4a suggest that clathrin dependent recycling from the plasma
   membrane may be regulated by rapid phosphorylation (Synj1, Itsn2 and
   Bin1). Furthermore, three chromogranins (ChgA, ChgB and Scg2) involved
   in granule biogenesis and insulin exocytosis [[139]6, [140]40] were
   dynamically phosphorylated upon glucose stimulation in INS-1E cells.
   Phosphorylation of these proteins might points to the existence of a
   still elusive glucose regulated kinase localized in the lumen of
   secretory granules [[141]41].

   Proteins controlling cytosolic pH (SLC4a4, SLC4a7, SLCa3r1) were also
   rapidly regulated (Fig. [142]4b). SLC4A4 and 7 are plasma membrane
   Na^+/HCO[3]^− exchangers expressed in pancreatic beta-cells [[143]42],
   whereas SLC9a3r1 encodes NHERF1 a regulatory cofactor of the Na^+/H^+
   exchanger, important to maintain cellular pH homeostasis.

   Three key regulators of cytosolic Ca^2+ fluxes were also
   phospho-regulated in our dataset: the plasma membrane Ca^2+-ATPase
   (PMCAs [Ser17]; ATP2b1), the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca^2+-ATPase
   (SERCAs [Ser17]; ATP2a3), and the stromal interaction molecule 1 (Stim1
   [Ser519/Ser523]), a key component of store operated Ca^2+ entry (SOCE)
   [[144]43] (Fig. [145]4b). The two p-sites on Stim1 [Ser519/523] are
   located in the C-terminal domain of the protein, interacting with Orai1
   at the plasma membrane. Alternative regulated p-sites of Stim1
   [Ser486/575/608/631/688] have been found previously in the cytosolic
   tail of the protein between the CAD domain and the C-terminal amino
   acid. Phosphorylation strongly modulate Stim1/Orai1 interaction,
   required for the regulation of store operated Ca^2+ fluxes [[146]44,
   [147]45]. A number of studies point to a role for SOCE in the control
   of Ca^2+ homeostasis/signaling during beta-cell activation mediated by
   nutrients [[148]43, [149]46]. We provide additional evidence that the
   temporal control of phospho-regulation in the C-terminal tail of Stim1
   is an important mechanism for the temporal control of SOCE during
   glucose-induced insulin secretion.

   Several p-sites belonging to proteins engaged in vesicle trafficking
   and biogenesis were rapidly regulated by glucose (Fig. [150]4c). These
   proteins are essential components for vesicular traffic between the
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi (Sec16a, Sec22b and Trappc8),
   control of Golgi function and morphology (Ttgn, Nsfl1c, Trip11, Myo18a
   and Arfgef1), insulin granule biogenesis (Arfgef3), granule transport
   and polarized secretion (Lrba, Dennd4c and Myo5a) and the bidirectional
   vesicular transport between the Golgi and endosomes (Coro7, Clint1,
   Erc1, Snx2, Vipas39). The fact that Sec16 which defines ER exit sites
   and Sec22b involved in the recycling of COPII coated vesicles undergo
   glucose-dependent phosphoregulation indicates that already very early
   steps in insulin trafficking are likely controlled by glucose
   [[151]47]. A very interesting protein is Arfgef3/BIG3. This Arf-GTP
   exchange factor localizes to the trans Golgi network where it acts as a
   negative regulator of insulin granule biogenesis [[152]48].
   Glucose-dependent phosphorylation may be a mechanism to inhibit ArfGef3
   thereby enhancing the number of newly formed granules. The actin based
   motor protein Myo5a is another interesting phosphoprotein. It mediates
   the transport of insulin granules to the plasma membrane and binds the
   Rab-interacting protein MyRIP. cAMP dependent phosphorylation of MyRIP
   promotes interactions with the Rab protein rabphilin-3A and Myo5a.
   Whether Myo5a phosphorylation is contributing to the regulation of
   granule transport remains to be investigated.

   Both the tubulin and actin cytoskeleton play an important role in the
   efficient delivery of secretory granules to docking sites at the plasma
   membrane [[153]49]. Phosphorylation of a large number of proteins
   regulating tubulin (Stmn1, Clasp1, Eml3, Map4 and Slain2) and actin
   (Cd2ap, Ebp41I3, Add2, Dbn1, Tagln2, Dmtn, Cttn, Lrch2, Ccdc88a, Wipf2,
   Evl, Ppp1r12a and Synpo2) dynamics and structure was observed (Fig.
   [154]4d). The majority of these phosphorylation changes occur within
   the first 5 min of glucose stimulation. Stmn1 (Stathmin1) regulates the
   tubulin cytoskeleton by destabilizing microtubule filaments. Glucose
   caused phosphorylation changes on S16 and S25 of Stmn1 (Fig. [155]4d).
   Phosphorylation of S16 is known to regulate the ability of Stmn1 to
   control microtubule polymerization [[156]50]. In the context of the
   beta-cell it is interesting to note that Stmn1 expression is
   upregulated during pregnancy-induced islet expansion [[157]51]. Wipf2
   (WAS/WASL-interacting protein family member 2) may be an important
   regulator of the actin cytoskeleton [[158]52]. Wipf2 binds to N-WASP
   regulating actin dynamics close to the plasma membrane. N-WASP in turn
   through the regulation of the Arp2/3 complex controls second phase
   insulin secretion [[159]17].

   Glucose-induced insulin secretion is also closely associated with a
   pronounced increase in protein translation and insulin biosynthesis
   [[160]13, [161]14]. Aligned with these findings, we observe regulation
   by phosphorylation of proteins required for protein translation and
   targeting of the protein nascent chain to the ER (Eef2, Eif2s2, Eif4f1,
   Aarsd1, Fxr2, Rlp34 and Srp14; Fig. [162]4e). We find two translation
   initiation factors (Eif2s2, Eif4f1) controlled by phosphorylation.
   These changes similar to dephosphorylation of the translation
   initiation factor 2α by protein phosphatase 1 [[163]14] may contribute
   to glucose-induced activation of protein biosynthesis. Similarly,
   protein elongation may be controlled by phosphorylation of Eef2 on T57
   (Fig. [164]4e). Indeed, when T57 is phosphorylated Eeef2 activity is
   inhibited [[165]53]. Glucose-induced dephosphorylation of this protein
   may therefore accelerate protein elongation.

   We could only find a few metabolic enzymes regulated by phosphorylation
   (Pgm1, Pgm3, Osbp2, Ampd2, Phyhipl and Elac2; Fig. [166]4f), which for
   most part were differentially phosphorylated only after 30–60 min (Fig.
   [167]4g). Although glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism of
   glucose-derived pyruvate are almost immediately accelerated following
   glucose stimulation, these kinetic changes are not likely influenced by
   regulation of enzyme activity by phosphorylation. An interesting
   phosphoprotein in this group is phosphoglucomutase Pgm1. The enzyme
   converts glucose 1-phosphate from glycogenolysis to the glycolytic
   intermediate glucose 6-phosphate and vice versa. S117 of Pgm1 is
   phosphorylated as part of the catalytic mechanism of this reaction
   [[168]54]. Augmented S117 phosphorylation therefore likely reflects
   active conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate for
   glycogen synthesis in the continued presence of elevated glucose.

   In summary, this overview of glucose-regulated phosphorylation
   highlights some of the complexity how signal transduction regulates
   beta-cell functions. We conclude that phosphorylation kinetics of
   proteins controlling early events in glucose-induced insulin secretion
   are rapid.

Dynamic regulation of kinases and phosphatases by glucose

   Starting from our kinetic phospho-proteomic datasets, we used KSEA
   [[169]35]) to infer changes in kinase activities. Briefly, 125 out of
   3086 identified p-sites were matched to Kinase-substrate relationship
   databases and KSEA scores were calculated for every experimental
   replicate. The output of the analysis provided evidence on the possible
   activity of 122 different kinases and phosphatases
   (Additional file [170]13: Figure S5). Subsequently averages of
   replicates were calculated and hierarchical clustering was applied to
   display the 30 most significantly activated and inhibited kinases and
   phosphatases (Fig. [171]5a-b).

   2 < are highlighted with a black dot. c-d Trajectory clusters reporting
   temporal profiling of individual kinase/phosphatase activities. c

   The results of KSEA showed that the protein kinases MAP2K1/2 (also
   known as MEK1/2) were significantly activated at all time points.
   Moreover the analysis revealed a trend of activation for DYRK2, a
   dual-specificity protein kinase, PRKCA and -B (Protein kinase C),
   MAPK13 (a member of p38 MAPK family), CAMK4, MAPK3 and-1 (ERK1/2),
   PRKACA (Protein kinase A) and AKT (Fig. [174]5a). Conversely, KSEA
   reported significant inhibition of EEF2K and NUAK and displayed
   inhibitory trends for AMPK, MAPK-p38, Cdk1/CyclinB and MAPK7 (Fig.
   [175]5b). Interestingly KSEA revealed significant inhibition of the
   non-receptor dual-specificity phosphatases DUSP-1, − 3 and − 4, the
   membrane receptors with tyrosine phosphatase activity PTPRE, PTPRJ,
   PTPRR and the non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTPN7 (Fig. [176]5a).
   In contrast, the analysis showed a slightly higher activity of
   Calcineurin (PPP3CA and PPP2CB) upon glucose stimulation (Fig.
   [177]5b).

   For several well-known kinases such as Raf, PKC family, PKA, AKT, AMPK
   and Eef2k, we looked at the time-course of effector protein
   phosphorylation. Furthermore, we used p-site specific antibodies to
   follow phosphorylation changes on a specific substrate of each of these
   kinase families by Western blotting. Quantification of effector protein
   phosphorylation over time reveals the basis of KSEA prediction of
   kinase activity and the robustness of this approach
   (Additional file [178]14: Figure S6). Analysis of specific protein
   phosphorylation changes by Western blotting allowed us to obtain
   independent confirmation of the results. We observed rapid and robust
   phosphorylation of substrates of the Raf MAP kinase pathway in response
   to glucose (Additional file [179]14: Figure S6A) using both, MS-derived
   data and immuno-based results. Phosphorylation of the PKC
   (Additional file [180]14: Figure S6B), PKA (Additional file [181]14:
   Figure S6C) and Akt (Additional file [182]14: Figure S6D) family
   substrates was equally rapid but less marked than expected from
   MS-derived data. MS-based phosphoproteomics and Western analysis also
   demonstrated rapid inactivation of AMPK (Additional file [183]14:
   Figure S6E) and Eef2k (Additional file [184]14: Figure S6F) activity.

   Time resolved kinase/phosphatases activities can give new insights into
   the temporal regulation of glucose stimulated insulin secretion. To
   this end, we identified groups of kinases/phosphatases according to
   their temporal KSEA score trajectories. Overall, we note that when
   classifying the kinases/phosphatases by which direction they present
   their largest regulation (measured as changes in KSEA score over time
   during three consecutive time points) nearly 70% of the them are in the
   group of positive KSEA scores already at 5 min (Fig. [185]5c and
   Additional file [186]15: Figure S7). In contrast, for half of the
   nearly 30% kinases/phosphatases displaying negative KSEA scores, the
   reduction occurs only after 60 min (Fig. [187]5d and
   Additional file [188]15: Figure S7). Kinases and phosphatases belonging
   to the top 30 positive and negatively regulated enzymes assigned to
   specific trajectories are listed in Fig. [189]5c and d. Kinases and
   phosphatases regulated early on should influence both first and second
   phase insulin secretion. Those undergoing changes at intermediate or
   late time-points may primarily affect the second phase of the secretory
   response.

Glucose-regulated kinases contributing to the regulation of mitochondrial
energy metabolism

   We hypothesized that glucose-induced signal transduction contributes to
   the full respiratory response beyond the role of calcium in the
   stimulation of beta-cell mitochondria. To test the relevance of
   different cytosolic signal transduction pathways predicted with KSEA,
   we used pharmacological inhibitors and activators and tested to what
   extent they affected glucose-induced respiration in INS-1E cells. A
   total of 27 compounds were tested at three different concentrations
   (Additional file [190]16: Table S9).

   Respiration was measured in INS-1E cells kept initially at resting
   glucose (2.5 mM) concentrations. At this point, inhibitors and
   activators of specific signal transduction pathways were added to
   determine whether the pharmacological agents affected basal respiratory
   rates. Thirty minutes later, the INS-1E cells were stimulated with
   glucose to accelerate respiration (Fig. [191]6a inset). The respiratory
   responses to glucose (16.7 mM) in the presence of pharmacological
   agents were quantified as the area under the curve over basal
   respiration and compared to the glucose response in mock treated cells.
   An overview of the fold changes and statistical significance compared
   to the control respiratory response is shown in Fig. [192]6a. The large
   majority of compounds tested caused no significant changes in the
   respiratory response to glucose. Manipulation of PKA activity did not
   alter mitochondrial energy function. Agents raising or lowering cAMP
   and the PKA inhibitor KT5720 (see also Fig. [193]6c) did not affect the
   respiratory response. Only the PKA inhibitor H89 caused a highly
   significant reduction of the glucose-induced respiratory response (Fig.
   [194]6a), however H89 affected respiration in general even under
   resting glucose conditions (Additional file [195]17: Figure S8). PKA
   activity may affect mitochondrial respiration but stimulation of PKA is
   not required for the acute glucose stimulated respiratory response.
   Acute manipulation of AMPK does not influence respiration in INS-1E
   cells. Inhibition of AMPK with compound-C or activation of AMPK with
   AICAR (to prevent glucose-induced inhibition of AMPK) had no effect on
   glucose-induced respiration (see also Fig. [196]6b). The exception was
   the AMPK activator phenformin, which inhibited respiration in INS-1E
   cells (Additional file [197]17: Figure S8). Most likely reduction of
   respiration by phenformin happens via the inhibition of complex I of
   the respiratory chain rather than the activation of AMPK [[198]55].
   Although MEK signaling is strongly activated by glucose (Fig. [199]5a),
   this pathway does not appear to contribute to glucose-induced
   respiration. We observed no alteration of respiration when the MAP
   kinase pathway was blocked at the level of MEK1 using PD98059 (Fig.
   [200]6c).

   mitochondrial respiration

   On the other hand, our pharmacological data suggest that PI3Kinase, PKC
   and calmodulin-dependent kinase type-II may contribute to acute
   glucose-induced activation of mitochondrial function. Drugs targeting
   the above-mentioned kinases lowered the full respiratory response to
   glucose without significantly changing resting respiratory rates. The
   phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (0.1–10 μM) reduced
   glucose-induced respiration in a dose dependent manner (Fig. [203]6e).
   Consistent with our earlier published results [[204]28], PKC inhibition
   (Go6983) reduced glucose-induced respiration (Fig. [205]6f). Finally,
   KN-62, a calmodulin-dependent kinase type II inhibitor caused a
   significant reduction of respiratory rates during glucose activation of
   INS-1E cells (Fig. [206]6g).

Discussion

   Insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta-cell is biphasic. The first
   phase is dependent on a readily releasable pool of granules.
   Interestingly, during glucose clamp experiments, secretion during the
   second phase continuous to rise gradually for 2 h and more. Such
   findings suggest that full activation of beta-cells may occur over an
   extended period of time. Full activation of beta-cells may occur
   gradually to adjust to the energy load and duration of a meal.
   Similarly, glucose activation of beta-cell mitochondria is almost
   instantaneous but subsequently respiratory rates increase steadily for
   up to one hour in a calcium dependent manner.

   The transition of beta-cells from a resting to an activated state goes
   beyond its metabolic activation by glucose and consequent promotion of
   insulin secretion. Glucose stimulation also affects a large number of
   biological processes linked to insulin biosynthesis, early membrane
   trafficking and insulin granule biogenesis and transport. Stimulation
   of these biological processes suggests the loss of insulin granules due
   to exocytosis needs to be balanced by de novo synthesis. To coordinate
   the chain of events from insulin biosynthesis to exocytosis, glucose
   indirectly activates a number of signal transduction pathways. It is
   interesting that glucose alone is able to initiate these signaling
   pathways without the assistance of peptide hormones and
   neurotransmitters known to potentiate insulin secretion. Stimulation of
   these signaling pathways may contribute to gradual beta-cell activation
   during the second phase of insulin secretion.

   The initial response to glucose (5 min) coinciding with first phase
   insulin secretion was compared to increasing times of continuous
   glucose stimulation occurring during second phase insulin secretion
   (30 min) and later activation (60 min). We observed a total of 234
   p-sites significantly regulated by glucose. The large majority of
   glucose dependent changes were limited to one or two time-points. Only
   33 p-sites were significantly and commonly regulated at the three time
   points. Our findings as well as earlier phosphoproteomics studies
   [[207]31–[208]33] underline the importance of studying the kinetics of
   glucose-induced activation in insulin secreting cells. Many p-sites
   sites identified here in insulin secreting cells have been detected
   previously in large-scale proteomic surveys across multiple rat, mouse
   or human tissues [[209]56, [210]57]. For example, this is the case for
   50 of the 83 p-sites displayed in Fig. [211]4. Identification of
   specific p-sites in multiple tissues supports a possible regulatory
   role and by extension a regulatory role in beta-cells. In fact, a large
   number of p-sites have already been revealed by earlier beta cell
   phospho proteomic studies [[212]31–[213]33].

   To properly describe the kinetics of phosphorylation during glucose
   activation, we applied a clustering method of p-site trajectories. We
   identified four groups of p-sites with distinctive time-dependent
   phosphorylation patterns (Fig. [214]3a). To identify potential
   relationships between the p-site trajectories and the regulation of
   particular cellular functions, cell process enrichment was compared
   across groups. The analysis revealed the rapid and broad consequences
   of glucose stimulation on the phospho-proteome in insulin secreting
   cells (Fig. [215]3c). Early phospho-proteome remodeling included
   proteins involved in the regulation of cytoskeleton organization,
   signal transduction, transcriptional/translational regulation of gene
   expression and membrane trafficking along the secretory pathway,
   membrane recycling and exocytosis. Most of these proteins remain
   regulated over the first 30 and 60 min (Fig. [216]3b). Proteins
   involved in carbohydrate metabolism, energy homeostasis and Ca^2+
   transport were mostly regulated at the later time-points after
   initiation of glucose stimulation (30 and 60 min). Theses cellular
   processes may be required for the gradual long-term nutrient activation
   of beta-cells associated with a net increase of insulin secretion.

   In addition to the systematic analysis of phosphorylation changes as
   described above, we also specifically focused on categories of effector
   proteins involved in metabolism, calcium signaling, protein (insulin)
   translation, regulation of the cytoskeleton, insulin trafficking,
   insulin granule biogenesis and exocytosis. All these biological
   processes are closely linked to the secretion of insulin and its
   regulation (Fig. [217]4). Included were those phosphorylation sites
   with a fold change (Log2) compared to control > 0.3 or < − 0.3. In this
   selection of p-sites, the large majority of significant phosphorylation
   changes already occurred at 5 min revealing rapid glucose-induced
   activation of signal transduction. The exception was metabolism. The
   few post-translationally modified metabolic enzymes were phosphorylated
   for most part only after 30 min in the presence of glucose. The
   relevance of several phosphoproteins for beta-cell functions in each of
   the biological processes has been already summarized in the result
   section.

   The phosphorylation status of individual p-sites is determined by the
   activity of a subset of kinases and phosphatases whose relationships
   are annotated in a number of open access databases. This wealth of
   information makes it possible to deduce kinase activities from
   phosphoproteomic data sets. Here we used KSEA to calculate changes in
   kinase and phosphatatase activities based on our collective p-site
   results following stimulation of INS-1E cells with glucose. There are
   two strong arguments in favor of the usefulness of this approach to
   predict kinase and phosphatase activities. First, we observed a good
   agreement between KSEA and Western blotting results. Phosphorylation of
   substrates that were used to predict the activity of kinases in the MAP
   kinase pathway, PKC family, PKA, Akt, AMPK and Eef2K follow a
   time-course similar to the time-dependent phosphorylation of individual
   substrates revealed using p-site specific antibodies. Second, many of
   the results obtained by KSEA confirm earlier published work on
   individual signaling pathways and their regulation in beta-cells. By
   extension, KSEA may predict the activation of signal transduction
   pathways less well understood in beta-cells. We conclude KSEA is a
   powerful tool to understand short-term glucose dependent regulation of
   kinase and phosphatases in insulin secreting cells. It should be
   mentioned however that the limited p-site coverage in our study (3085
   p-sites) and the dependence of our work on rat cells (INS-1E), whose
   kinase-substrate databases are less annotated, reduced the power of
   this analysis [[218]35].

   The contribution of different glucose-stimulated kinases to acute
   glucose-induced insulin secretion are still debated. PKC, PKA and
   ERK1/2 activities have been shown to promote insulin secretion mainly
   through the regulation of the cytoskeleton and the activation of the
   last steps in insulin granule exocytosis [[219]19]. In our study, the
   most strongly inhibited kinase following glucose stimulation is EEF2K.
   Rapid p-site dephosphorylation of Eef2 (T57) observed in our proteomic
   dataset was confirmed by Western blotting. This regulation is essential
   for glucose dependent stimulation of protein translation. NUAK1 was the
   second most inhibited kinase activity detected with KSEA. NUAK1 is a
   member of the AMPK-related protein kinase family, and an important
   regulator of cell senescence, adhesion, migration and cellular
   metabolism In vitro, its activity is positively regulated by increasing
   levels of AMP [[220]58]. During glucose stimulation, AMP concentrations
   rapidly decline explaining inhibition of NUAK1 and AMPK. Results with
   muscle specific KO mice suggest that NUAK1 suppresses glucose uptake
   through negative regulation of insulin signaling in oxidative muscle
   [[221]59]. To date, NUAK1 has not been studied in pancreatic
   beta-cells. Whether acute and/or chronic regulation of AMPK itself has
   an impact on insulin secretion is not clear [[222]24, [223]60–[224]62].
   KSEA also points to the glucose regulation of a number of phosphatases.
   Calcineurin was found to be activated, consistent with reports from the
   literature. Furthermore, KSEA predicted dual-specificity phosphoprotein
   phosphatases (DUSPs) to be strongly and rapidly inhibited following
   glucose stimulation. In vitro, DUSPs inactivate mitogen-activated
   protein (MAP) kinase by dephosphorylation.

   A second objective of this study was to identify links between signal
   transduction and mitochondrial energy metabolism. Glucose primarily
   stimulates mitochondria through the provision of substrates causing an
   almost immediate increase of respiration followed by a gradual increase
   of respiration over a time course of 5–60 min. This second phase after
   glucose addition depends almost completely on calcium signaling. Here
   we tested whether in addition to calcium other signaling pathways
   associated with glucose stimulation are able to modulate the
   mitochondrial respiratory response to the nutrient. We hypothesized
   that glucose regulated-kinases may have mitochondrial protein
   substrates that could link cytosolic signal transduction to
   mitochondrial activity. However, in our phospho-proteome dataset, we
   found only two proteins in the Mitocarta whose phosphorylation status
   was significantly changed following glucose stimulation: Elac2 [S800]
   and Phyhipl [S15]. Elac2 is an endonuclease removing 3′ nucleotides
   from tRNA precursor molecules. Phyhipl stands for phytanoyl-CoA
   hydroxylase-interacting protein-like. Neither protein suggests an
   obvious link to the short-term regulation of mitochondrial respiration
   by glucose.

   In order to test whether any of the signal transduction pathways
   associated with glucose stimulation predicted with KSEA impacts on the
   mitochondrial respiratory response, we pharmacologically manipulated
   key signaling pathways. Compounds were selected to target mTOR, MEK1/2,
   PI3kinase, p38MAPK, AMPK, Cam-kinase, calcineurin, cAMP levels, PKA and
   PKC. The majority of the 27 tested compounds (each compound was tested
   at three different concentrations) had no acute effect on
   glucose-induced respiration. The exceptions were inhibitors of the
   three kinases PKC, Cam-kinase and PI3K, which significantly lowered
   acceleration of respiration by glucose. The data with the PKC
   inhibitors confirmed our earlier findings demonstrating that the PKC
   inhibitor Go-6983 is able to lower the glucose induced respiratory
   response, while activation of PKC in the absence of stimulatory glucose
   is able to augment respiration [[225]28]. The CamK-II inhibitor KN62
   also caused a consistent reduction of glucose-induced respiration.
   These results are consistent with previous reports [[226]63, [227]64].
   KN62 was found to impair Ca^2+ signaling strongly reducing
   depolarization-induced cytosolic calcium rises. Inhibition of
   respiration is therefore likely the consequence of lowered calcium
   signals in the cytosol and as a consequence the mitochondrial matrix.
   Preventing mitochondrial Ca^2+ rises is known to inhibit
   glucose-induced respiration [[228]11]. Surprisingly, KN93, an
   alternative inhibitor of CamK II failed to inhibit the glucose
   respiratory response although it was shown previously to affect calcium
   signaling similar to KN62. Whether and how CamK II affects
   mitochondrial function requires further experiments.

   Interestingly, the PI3kinase inhibitor wortmanin lowered
   glucose-induced respiration. PI3 kinase is an essential lipid kinase
   activated during insulin receptor signaling. PI3 kinase activity is
   restricted to the plasma membrane and acts upstream of Akt/PKB. In
   beta-cells, insulin signaling is initiated following glucose
   stimulation as insulin secretion leads to rapid autocrine activation of
   the insulin receptor. It is therefore not surprising that our KSEA
   analysis identified Akt among the rapidly activated kinases (Fig.
   [229]5a and Additional file [230]14: Figure S6). Among the proteins
   phosphorylated by Akt are well-established mitochondrial substrates
   such as Bad or Bcl-xl, and Akt can even accumulate into the
   mitochondria [[231]65]. Such Akt substrates may mediate the stimulatory
   effect of insulin receptor signaling on mitochondrial respiration. A
   second possible explanation for the activation of mitochondrial
   respiration by Akt is via stimulation of glycolysis. Akt activation has
   been shown in a number of cell types to increase glycolytic rates
   through regulation of glucose transport, hexokinase and
   phosphofructokinase activity. Whatever the exact mechanism, our results
   show that insulin signaling contributes to the acute regulation of
   mitochondrial activity during glucose stimulation.

   Our pharmacological study also provides a number of valuable
   information on signaling pathways not regulating the acute respiratory
   response. Among the many compound used to manipulate cAMP and PKA
   signaling none altered glucose-induced respiration. Furthermore, acute
   inhibition or activation of AMPK did not influence respiration in
   INS-1E cells. The two calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine A and FK506
   also had no effect on the respiratory response to glucose. Lastly, the
   mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin did not modified the glucose-dependent
   respiratory response (Fig. [232]6a). Short-term regulation of these
   kinases and phosphatases does not likely influence mitochondrial
   function in beta-cells.

Conclusions

   Glucose stimulation quickly remodels the beta-cell phosphoproteome over
   the first hour in presence of the nutrient, affecting a large number of
   biological processes linked to insulin biosynthesis, early membrane
   trafficking, insulin granule biogenesis and transport, exocytosis and
   cytoskeleton dynamics.

   The present study provides us with a wealth of information regarding
   the kinetics and the activation and inhibition of kinases and
   phosphatases and paves the way to study their contribution to the
   regulation of beta-cell function.

   Our study also gives new insight into beta-cell signaling and
   interactions with glucose-induced metabolic activation of mitochondria,
   a key cellular event for the transition from a resting to an activated
   beta-cell. We observe that three nutrient activated kinases:
   phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase and
   protein kinase C crosstalk to mitochondrial energy metabolism.
