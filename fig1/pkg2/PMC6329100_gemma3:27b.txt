Here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis methods described in the provided text, formatted for a table:

**1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**

*   DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) version 6.8
*   WebGestalt 2017 (WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit)

**2. Was a tool version number provided?**

*   DAVID: Yes, version 6.8
*   WebGestalt: Yes, 2017

**3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**

*   Gene Ontology (GO) - BP, CC, and MF
*   KEGG pathways

**4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**

*   Yes, the *Bos taurus* genome was used as a background for both DAVID and WebGestalt analyses.

**5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**

*   Overrepresentation Enrichment Analysis (ORA) was used with both tools. The specific statistical test *within* ORA is not explicitly stated.

**6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**

*   Yes. A False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 5% was used as a threshold for significance in both DAVID and WebGestalt analyses.
