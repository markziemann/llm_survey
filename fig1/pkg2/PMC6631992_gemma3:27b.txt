|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | ToppGene (an application of the ToppGene suite)                            |
| 2. Was a tool version number provided?       | Not described                                                              |
| 3. What gene set library was queried?      | GO (Gene Ontology)                                                           |
| 4. Was a background gene list defined?     | Yes, the authors analyzed 82 wound-healing related genes.                    |
