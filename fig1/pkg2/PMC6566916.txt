Abstract

   Black and red rice are rich in both anthocyanin and proanthocyanin
   content, which belong to a large class of flavonoids derived from a
   group of phenolic secondary metabolites. However, the molecular
   pathways and mechanisms underlying the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway
   are far from clear. Therefore, this study was undertaken to gain
   insight into physiological factors that are involved in the flavonoid
   biosynthetic pathway in rice cultivars with red, black, and white
   colors. RNA sequencing of caryopsis and isobaric tags for relative and
   absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analyses have generated a nearly
   complete catalog of mRNA and expressed proteins in different colored
   rice cultivars. A total of 31,700 genes were identified, of which 3417,
   329, and 227 genes were found specific for red, white, and black rice,
   respectively. A total of 13,996 unique peptides corresponding to 3916
   proteins were detected in the proteomes of black, white, and red rice.
   Coexpression network analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
   and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) among the different rice
   cultivars showed significant differences in photosynthesis and
   flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Based on a differential enrichment
   analysis, 32 genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were
   detected, out of which only CHI, F3H, ANS, and FLS were detected by
   iTRAQ. Taken together, the results point to differences in flavonoid
   biosynthesis pathways among different colored rice cultivars, which may
   reflect differences in physiological functions. The differences in
   contents and types of flavonoids among the different colored rice
   cultivars are related to changes in base sequences of Os06G0162500,
   Os09G0455500, Os09G0455500, and Os10G0536400. Current findings expand
   and deepen our understanding of flavonoid biosynthesis and concurrently
   provides potential candidate genes for improving the nutritional
   qualities of rice.

1. Introduction

   Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important global crop
   that feeds approximately half of the human population [[51]1]. Rice is
   generally categorized based on caryopsis color into red, black, and
   white cultivars. It is well known that black and red rice are more
   nutritious than white rice. Additionally, in comparison to white rice,
   black and red rice are richer in secondary metabolites such as phenols
   and flavonoids. Studies suggest that pigmented rice has important
   biological activities including stronger antioxidant capacity, reduced
   cardiovascular disease risk, and prevention of cholesterol absorption
   [[52]2,[53]3,[54]4,[55]5]. Therefore, an understanding of the genetic
   and biochemical bases of metabolic functions among different pigmented
   rice cultivars will be greatly appreciated.

   Flavonoids are widely distributed secondary metabolites with a range of
   metabolic functions in plants. Most pigmented rice cultivars are rich
   in flavonoids, which are derived from phenolic secondary metabolites
   [[56]6]. The major flavonoids in black rice are anthocyanins, mainly
   consisting of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and peonidin-3-O-glucoside,
   whereas red rice is rich in proanthocyanidins and flavan-3-ols
   oligomers, which have catechin as the main extension unit
   [[57]7,[58]8,[59]9,[60]10,[61]11]. Significant efforts have been made
   to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids as well as their
   regulation by myeloblastosis (MYB) and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
   transcription factors together with WD40 proteins [[62]12,[63]13].
   These transcription factors belong to multigenic families encompassing
   162 members in Arabidopsis and 167 members in rice, and several of them
   participate in regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis
   [[64]14,[65]15,[66]16]. There are also other factors that affect the
   regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis, including light and sugar
   [[67]17,[68]18,[69]19]. Additionally, several genes are involved in
   photosynthesis, but only some of these genes participate in the
   regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis; for example, among dicotyledonous
   species, flavone formation is primarily catalyzed by CYP93B enzymes
   [[70]20]. However, there has been no systematic study to date that has
   assessed whether differential expression of transcription factors
   affects flavonoid biosynthesis and leads to different flavonoid
   products. Therefore, in the current study we performed an expression
   analysis of the transcription factors involved in flavonoid
   biosynthesis among different pigmented rice cultivars.

   High-throughput profiling of transcripts and proteins is an efficient
   method for deciphering the regulatory networks of functional genes that
   coordinately control complex biological processes [[71]21]. Moreover,
   bottom-up profiling of transcripts and proteins, together with
   coexpression network analyses, are powerful approaches for
   interrogating biological processes (e.g., development) and constitutes
   an important aspect of systems biology. While transcriptional profiling
   is the method of choice for investigating development because of its
   low cost, interrogation of changes in protein profiles is also crucial,
   as proteins ultimately control biological processes. A combination of
   both the transcriptome and proteome is important for providing an
   accurate illustration of physiological events. Technological advances
   have made it increasingly possible to detect mRNA expression by using
   RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and to probe protein abundance using iTRAQ
   (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) [[72]22]. Due to
   post-translational turnover and alternative translation efficiency, the
   integrated measurement and interpretation of changes in transcripts and
   protein abundance are mandatory for generating a complete inventory of
   gene networks [[73]21]. Thus, joint analyses of multiomics data offer a
   more comprehensive view of specific biological processes by increasing
   our understanding of gene networks [[74]23]. In an attempt to identify
   the pathways and physiological factors responsible for the differences
   in different pigmented rice cultivars, an integrative approach was used
   for profiling gene activity by RNA-Seq and iTRAQ. We compared the
   differences in abundance of mRNAs and proteins in the caryopses of
   different pigmented rice cultivars, and we found several key genes that
   were differentially expressed in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathways.
   We argue that the joint analysis of gene and protein expression data
   provides a comprehensive representation of the physiological factors
   that regulate flavonoid biosynthesis in different pigmented rice
   cultivars. This approach expands and deepens our understanding of
   flavonoid biosynthesis while concurrently providing potential candidate
   genes for improving the nutritional qualities of rice.

2. Results

2.1. Overview of the Transcriptome and Proteome

   Transcriptomes of caryopses of three rice cultivars were determined by
   RNA-Seq using a high-throughput Illumina platform. According to the RNA
   level line diagram ([75]Supplementary Figure S1A), levels of gene
   expression in red rice were highest, followed by the pericarp of black,
   and then caryopses of black and white rice. A total of 31,700 genes
   were detected in 10 samples. Percentages of reads mapped to the genome
   ranged from 75.74%–84.73% ([76]Supplementary Table S2). According to
   the congruence analysis between detected transcripts and expressed
   proteins, a total of 31,710 expressed genes and 3890 expressed proteins
   were detected ([77]Figure 1A). Around 27,820 genes and 26 proteins were
   detected only in the transcriptome and proteome, respectively.
   Furthermore, 3953 rice genes were not detected in our study ([78]Figure
   1A). The number of specifically expressed genes was the highest in red
   rice (3417), followed by white rice (329), and then black rice (227)
   ([79]Figure 1B). The three rice cultivars shared 16,349 genes in common
   ([80]Figure 1B). We identified 13,996 unique peptides from 211,526
   spectra, which corresponded to 3916 proteins in the six samples. The
   corresponding proteome was assessed and quantitatively catalogued using
   iTRAQ. The Mascot search algorithm was used to identify proteins.
   Robustness of the analysis was supported by multiple reaction
   monitoring (MRM) of six proteins from six samples ([81]Supplementary
   Table S3). Principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed that the three
   different rice cultivars were genetically distinct based on gene
   expression ([82]Supplementary Figure S1B). Additionally, the PCA showed
   relatively close distances between the replicate samples, whereas the
   distances between the different rice cultivars were significant
   ([83]Supplementary Figure S1B). Furthermore, the pericarp and endosperm
   of the black rice were also genetically distinct.

2.2. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) and Differentially Expressed
Proteins (DEPs)

   Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using NOIseq
   (log2FC (fold change) > 1 or log2FC < −1, probability > 0.8). When
   comparisons were made across the caryopses of the different rice
   cultivars, 614 uniquely expressed genes out of a total of 2409 DEGs
   ([86]Supplementary Table S4) were discovered between red and black rice
   ([87]Figure 1C). Similarly, between black and white rice, out of a
   total of 1551 DEGs, 343 genes were unique ([88]Supplementary Table S4).
   DEG comparisons between the red and white caryopses showed that out of
   a total of 1152 genes 107 were unique DEGs ([89]Supplementary Table
   S4).

   Analysis and comparison of the proteomes of the different rice
   cultivars also revealed that 92 DEPs out of a total of 371 DEPs
   ([90]Supplementary Table S5) were unique to black rice in comparison to
   red rice ([91]Figure 1E). Similarly, 48 DEPs out of a total of 164 DEPs
   ([92]Supplementary Table S5) were unique to red rice in comparison to
   white rice. Furthermore, 161 DEPs out of a total of 422 DEPs
   ([93]Supplementary Table S5) were unique to black rice versus white
   rice ([94]Figure 1E). Twenty DEPs were common to all rice cultivars
   ([95]Figure 1D).

   Comparisons of the different rice cultivars indicated that the numbers
   of upregulated DEGs were 944, 242, and 214 between red and white rice,
   black and white rice, and black and red rice, respectively ([96]Figure
   1D). In contrast, there were 208, 1309, and 2195 downregulated DEGs in
   the corresponding comparisons, respectively ([97]Figure 1D). The number
   of upregulated genes was, thus, highest in red rice, followed by white
   rice and then black rice ([98]Figure 1E).

   DEPs were categorized based on 1.5-fold change (FC) in combination with
   a p value < 0.05. The numbers of upregulated DEPs were 61, 315, and 321
   between red and white rice, black and red rice, and black and white
   rice, respectively ([99]Figure 1F). In contrast, the numbers of
   downregulated DEPs were 103, 57, and 103 in the corresponding
   comparisons, respectively ([100]Figure 1F).

2.3. Transcript Profiling of the Pericarp and Endosperm of Black Rice

   The pericarp of black rice is pigmented because of the accumulation of
   a variety of anthocyanins, while the endosperm is colorless. Therefore,
   we analyzed the transcriptomes of the pericarp and endosperm in order
   to understand their role in color variation in rice. Comparisons of the
   endosperm and pericarp of black rice revealed 2568 DEGs, of which 1590
   were unique. Ninety-three DEGs were common to all rice cultivars
   including the black rice pericarp vs. endosperm ([101]Figure 1C).
   Furthermore, DEG analysis ([102]Figure 1E) indicated that the number of
   upregulated genes in pericarp vs. endosperm (2217) was almost seven
   times that of the downregulated genes (351).

2.4. Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis of DEGs and DEPs in the Different Rice
Cultivars

   To analyze the functions of DEPs and DEGs in different rice cultivars,
   gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were performed on four sets of
   DEGs (black rice pericarp vs. endosperm, black rice vs. red rice
   caryopsis, black rice vs. white rice caryopsis, and red rice vs. white
   rice caryopsis) and three sets of DEPs (black rice vs. red rice
   caryopsis, black rice vs. white rice caryopsis, and red rice vs. white
   rice caryopsis) based on the GO annotations
   ([103]http://geneontology.org/). [104]Figure 2 was drawn in Web Gene
   Ontology Annotation Plotting (BGI WEGO)
   ([105]http://wego.genomics.org.cn/cgi-bin/wego/index.pl) to show the
   percentage of DEGs and DEPs in the three GO categories: biological
   process, cellular component, and molecular function ([106]Figure 2;
   [107]Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). DEGs involved in biological
   processes were distributed in cellular processes, metabolic processes,
   and single-organism processes and were highest in comparison to the
   other processes. Photosynthesis was particularly enriched
   ([108]Supplementary Table S6), followed by metabolic pathways including
   flavonoid biosynthesis. Among cellular components, DEGs were highest in
   cells, cell parts, and organelle parts ([109]Figure 2A). In the
   molecular functions category, DEGs were highest in binding and
   catalytic activity followed by transporter activity. A similar pattern
   was observed for DEPs in the GO term annotation ([110]Figure 2B,
   [111]Supplementary Table S7). In addition to the high proportion of GO
   terms associated with metabolic processes, we also recorded DEGs and
   DEPs enriched in the response to stimulus, immune response, and
   developmental processes. Results of the enrichment test for DEPs
   indicated that rice proteins were primarily related to cell components
   and metabolic processes ([112]Figure 2B, [113]Supplementary Table S7).

   each GO term. The left Y-axis represents the percentage of each term,
   whereas the right Y-axis represents the genes/proteins corresponding to
   each GO term. Different colored bars represent different comparisons.

   To further assess differences among the different rice cultivars, we
   performed a PageMan analysis (P < 0.01 as the threshold) for different
   paired comparisons ([117]Figure 3A). Results indicated significant
   differences in the photosynthesis pathway, secondary metabolism,
   abiotic and biotic stress responses, and other pathways. Downregulated
   enrichment in black rice was far greater than in red rice ([118]Figure
   3A). Based on annotation results of flavonoid-related genes in the rice
   database, we selected 211 genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and
   performed a hierarchical cluster analysis ([119]Figure 3B). We also
   selected 132 genes that participated in flavonoid biosynthesis
   regulation in the photosynthesis pathway and performed a hierarchical
   cluster analysis ([120]Figure 3C). Results showed that the number of
   upregulated genes in red rice was higher than black and white rice,
   whether directly or indirectly participating in flavonoid biosynthesis.
   Then, we further analyzed DEGs involved in biosynthesis of flavonoid
   components in an attempt to better understand the genetic background of
   the differential expression of flavonoid components among paired
   comparisons. Thirty-two genes showed significant differences, including
   26 annotated genes and six unannotated genes.

   211 DEGs in the photosynthesis pathway; and (C) expression profiles and
   cluster analysis of 132 genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway.

   Importantly, these 32 genes mainly belonged to flavonoid biosynthesis
   and photosynthesis-related pathways ([123]Table 1). Out of those genes,
   Os11G0599200 encoding UDP-GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 72B3, Os01G0850900
   encoding the HEME-BINDING-LIKE protein At3g10130, Os06G0593800 encoding
   CROCETIN GLUCOSYLTRANSFERASE, Os02G0503100 encoding CYTOCHROME P450
   71A1, Os09G0275400 encoding PREMNASPIRODIENE OXYGENASE, and
   Os04G0320700 encoding 7-DEOXYLOGANETIN GLUCOSYLTRANSFERASE were
   important. Furthermore, the expression level of Os01g0906450 (−7.01 FC
   level) was highest in black rice compared with red rice. In particular,
   the expression level of Os01G0372500 encoding LEUCOANTHOCYANIDIN
   DIOXYGENASE for anthocyanin synthesis was higher in black rice than in
   red rice ([124]Table 1). Genotyping analysis of the 32 genes involved
   in flavonoid biosynthesis revealed that 232 single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) existed between the pigmented and white rice
   cultivars. Further, SNPs were annotated by ANNOVAR software [[125]24],
   and 51 synonymous mutations, 63 nonsynonymous mutations, 1 stoploss,
   and 2 stopgain mutations were found. Notably, GATK (Genome Analysis
   Toolkit, [126]https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) software
   revealed that four genes (Os06G0162500, Os09G0455500, Os09G0455500, and
   Os10G0536400) in the black and red rice cultivars existed in a
   heterozygous site, but they were located in a homozygous site in white
   rice ([127]Supplementary Table S8).

   We next analyzed the most significant differences in protein level
   abundance ([129]Table 2). Results showed that some of the genes
   encoding proteins with significantly different expression levels showed
   inconsistent trends; for example, gene Os03G0367101 encoding FLAVONOID
   3′,5′-HYDROXYLASE presented a significant difference in mRNA expression
   ([130]Table 1), but it was not significantly different at the protein
   level. Gene Os01G0176000 encoding UDP-GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 73C6
   presented significant differential expression at the protein level
   ([131]Table 2) but not at the mRNA level. Eight genes with significant
   differences in their expression and protein abundance are given in
   [132]Table S1.

2.5. Gene Coexpression Network Analysis

   We performed regulatory network analysis by GeneNet to analyze and
   elucidate how flavonoid biosynthesis pathway components interact with
   other regulatory pathways such as photosynthesis, phenylalanine, and
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism pathways ([134]Figure 4,
   [135]Supplementary Table S9). Expression levels of bHLH and MYB
   transcription factors did not differ significantly in the different
   rice cultivars. However, a number of genes of the bHLH and MYB pathways
   were differentially expressed. The core genes Os08G0434150,
   Os10G0331866, and Os01G0736000 encoding bHLH played a key role in the
   regulation of networks associated with bHLH and the flavonoid
   biosynthesis pathway ([136]Figure 4A). They probably directly or
   indirectly regulated the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway; for example,
   OS08G043415 regulates the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway via the
   Os04G0272700 encoding UDP-GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 92A1 and Os03G0702100
   (hypothetical protein). The core genes Os08G0434150, Os01G0619900, and
   Os02G0206550 encoding MYB, which participated in the flavonoid
   biosynthesis pathway, also played a key role in regulatory networks
   involved in sugars, ROS metabolism, and photosynthesis pathways
   ([137]Figure 4B). Peroxide and flavonoid regulation network core genes
   were OS01G0736000, Os02G0206550, and Os08G0434150 ([138]Supplementary
   Figure S2A); while phenylalanine and flavonoid regulation network core
   genes were Os01G0736000, Os02G0206550, and Os07G0571600
   ([139]Supplementary Figure S2B). In terms of photosynthesis and the
   flavonoid regulation network, the core genes were Os08G0434150,
   Os01G0736000, and Os02G0206550 ([140]Supplementary Figure S2C), whereas
   for sugar and the flavonoid regulation network, the core genes were
   Os07G0571600, Os02G0264700, and Os02G0206550 ([141]Supplementary Figure
   S2D).

2.6. Correlation Analysis between the Proteome and Transcriptome of Different
Rice Cultivars

   To explore the relationship between proteins and their cognate genes,
   we matched all expressed proteins with their cognate mRNAs among the
   three different pigmented rice cultivars ([145]Figure 5,
   [146]Supplementary Table S10). A weak, negative correlation was
   observed when black and red rice were compared (r value = −0.2327;
   [147]Figure 5A) and when black and white rice were compared (r value =
   −0.0336; [148]Figure 5B), whereas a weak, positive correlation was
   observed between red and white rice (r value = 0.0468; [149]Figure 5C).
   For example, correlation analysis of transcripts vs. peptides between
   black and red rice revealed that a handful of mRNAs showed a tendency
   for downregulation, whereas the corresponding proteins showed
   upregulation, including flavonoid and flavonoid biosynthesis-related
   factors ([150]Figure 5A). This indicated strong post-translational
   regulation. Analysis of all expressed genes with proteins between black
   and red rice showed a tendency for the expression of most of the
   expressed genes to be the same as the corresponding proteins, including
   those relating to flavonoid biosynthesis and transcription factors
   regulating flavonoid biosynthesis such as sugar, bHLH, MYB, and light
   ([151]Figure 5A). An opposite scenario was observed between the
   expressed genes and proteins when black and white rice were compared
   ([152]Figure 5B). Here, expression of all genes coincided with a
   similar pattern of protein presence. When red and white rice were
   compared, some mRNAs were downregulated, whereas corresponding proteins
   levels were not changed ([153]Figure 5C). In general, there was weak
   consistency between gene expression and proteins.

   Analysis for black and red rice; (B) analysis for black and white rice;
   and (C) analysis for red and white rice. The red dot represents genes
   and proteins for flavonoid, photosynthesis, sugar, phenylalanine,
   peroxide, MYB, and bHLH transcriptome factors. The black dot represents
   the other genes and proteins. The blue dotted lines express the
   thresholds of differential expression (the fold-change of the RNA is
   log2|FC| > 1; the fold-change of a protein is log2|FC > 1.5 or FC <
   0.667).

   Based on relative expression analysis, 204 genes/proteins that were
   significantly and differentially expressed in the different rice
   cultivars between transcript and protein analyses were selected
   ([156]Supplementary Table S10). Fifty-six transcripts and proteins were
   consistently and differentially expressed between black and red rice,
   whereas 104 transcripts and their proteins were consistently and
   differentially expressed between black and white rice. Additionally,
   164 transcripts and proteins were consistently and differentially
   expressed when red and white rice colored cultivars were compared. In
   contrast, 127, 62, and 15 genes were inconsistent between transcriptome
   and protein analyses for paired comparisons of the three rice cultivars
   (black vs. red, black vs. white, and red vs. white, respectively) such
   as Os01g0106400 encoding ISOFLAVONE REDUCTASE homolog of IRL,
   Os01g0124650 encoding BOWMAN-BIRK TYPE BRAN TRYPSIN INHIBITOR, and
   Os01g0228600 encoding HYDROXYPHENYLPYRUVATE REDUCTASE ([157]Table 3).
   Furthermore, 21, 36, and 25 genes were consistent between transcript
   and protein analyses for the paired comparisons of the three rice
   cultivars (black vs. red, black vs. white, and red vs. white,
   respectively) including Os01g0372500 encoding LEUCOANTHOCYANIDIN
   DIOXYGENASE. Interestingly, the number of genes with inconsistent
   relationships between transcript and protein analyses was highest
   between black and red rice among the paired comparisons. This indicated
   the need for a joint analysis of the transcriptome and proteome.

2.7. Evaluation of Data Related to the Flavonoid Biosynthesis Pathway

   Flavonoids are synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway ([159]Figure
   6) through the transformation of phenylalanine into 4-coumaroyl-CoA,
   which ultimately enters the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Based on
   enrichment analysis, we found 32 genes involved in the flavonoid
   biosynthesis pathway in rice. However, we only detected CHALCONE
   ISOMERASE (CHI), FLAVANONE 3-HYDROXYLASE (F3H), ANTHOCYANIN SYNTHASE
   (ANS), and FLAVANOL SYNTHASE (FLS) by iTRAQ (marked in red font in
   [160]Figure 6), whereas others including L-PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE
   (PAL), CHALCONE SYNTHASE (CHS), DIHYDROFLAVONOL 4-REDUCTASE (DFR), and
   ANTHOCYANIN REDUCTASE (ANR) were not detected. Naringenin,
   dihydrokaempferol, pelargonidin, dihydroquercetin, and cyanidin were
   the key metabolites identified by Liquid Chromatography/Mass
   Spectrometry (LC-MS). There were significant expressional differences
   in enzymes detected among the three different colored rice cultivars
   ([161]Figure 6A). Interestingly, genes downstream in the flavonoid
   biosynthesis pathway differed most significantly among the different
   rice cultivars. For example, in black rice the principal DEGs were
   Os01G0832600, Os03G0184550, Os06G0626700, and Os06G0651100 encoding for
   FLS, DFR, ANS, and ANR, respectively. For red rice, the principal DEGs
   were Os03G0289800, Os06G0162500, and Os04G0630900 encoding FLS, ANS,
   and ANR, respectively. Genes involved in DFR presented low expression
   levels in red rice. In contrast, in white rice all genes in the
   flavonoid biosynthesis pathway presented rather lower expression levels
   than in black and red rice ([162]Figure 6A). A significant difference
   in the pericarp and endosperm of black rice in the flavonoid synthesis
   pathway was also observed ([163]Figure 6B). Many genes that contributed
   to differences in the different rice cultivars were also differentially
   expressed between the pericarp and endosperm of black rice, such as
   genes encoding for F3H, ANS, FLS, and ANR. This clearly suggested that
   genes downstream in the flavonoid synthesis pathway were more
   differentially expressed than those upstream in the flavonoid
   biosynthesis pathway.

   represents the key metabolites.

   Quantitative expression analysis of genes involved in the flavonoid
   biosynthesis pathway corroborated transcriptomic data ([166]Figure 7).
   This may be related to the stability of the enzymes. Additionally, most
   enzymes were regulated by a few genes, except for flavonoid
   3′5′-hydroxylase, which was encoded by a single gene. For CHS,
   significantly higher expressions of Os04G0103900 in red and black rice
   were found compared to white rice. Similarly, all three genes involved
   in encoding CHI were significantly higher in red and black rice
   compared to white rice. Between red and black rice there were also
   significant differences in the expression of certain genes encoding for
   CHI, F3′5′H, FLS, DFR, ANS, and ANR ([167]Figure 7).

3. Discussion

   Our transcriptomic and proteomic study of different pigmented rice
   cultivars showed that there was substantial concordance between the
   proteins and transcripts. In fact, transcripts were detected for 99.34%
   of the proteins. Twenty-six proteins that were detected by proteomics
   analysis were not detected in the mRNA analysis, which was attributed
   to mRNA half-life and stability. Interestingly, 27,820 genes were only
   detected in the transcriptome, but there were no protein counterparts,
   which could be because they were transcription regulation factors.
   Thus, only a modest concordance (12.26%) was observed between the
   transcriptome and the proteome. Several differential transcriptomic and
   proteomic studies demonstrated a modest concordance between mRNA levels
   and proteins [[170]24,[171]25,[172]26]. This discordance between mRNA
   and proteins can arise during the flow of genetic information from DNA
   to the ultimate phenotype. Furthermore, protein levels are influenced
   by translational and post-translational processes that result in a
   dynamic proteome [[173]27].

   The maximum number of upregulated DEGs was found when the caryopsis of
   red rice was compared with white rice, whereas a contrasting pattern
   was observed when black rice was compared with white rice. However,
   this trend was completely opposite when the proteomic data were
   analyzed. Upregulated DEPs were higher in black rice than white rice
   and lower in red rice than white rice. Many of these genes and proteins
   are involved in various metabolic pathways, including the biosynthesis
   of secondary metabolites, photosynthesis, and flavonoid biosynthesis.
   It is reasonable to speculate that various physiological factors, as
   well as the genes and proteins involved in the biosynthesis of
   flavonoid components, governed the observed metabolic differences and
   would have influenced DEGs and DEPs among the different rice cultivars.
   GO classification by WEGO analysis of DEGs and DEPs revealed enrichment
   in metabolic, photosynthetic, and flavonoid biosynthetic processes.
   Numerous studies suggested that transcription factors such as bHLH and
   MYB participated in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis genes
   [[174]13,[175]14,[176]15,[177]16]. Thus, transcription factors together
   with their interactions determine the activation as well as spatial and
   temporal expressions of structural genes in anthocyanin biosynthesis. A
   single enzyme can be synthesized by many genes; however, it is likely
   that differences between DEGs and DEPs are derived from the speed of
   mRNA synthesis and post-transcription regulation as well as other
   translational and post-translational mechanisms [[178]12,[179]28].

   Significant differences in the different rice cultivars also existed in
   pathways associated with photosynthesis, secondary metabolism, and
   abiotic and biotic stress responses. Regulation of plant development
   and gene expression by light, an important environmental factor, is
   well known [[180]29,[181]30]. The elevation of anthocyanin pigments and
   CHS in response to light has been demonstrated in Arabidopsis seedlings
   [[182]31]. Additionally, for metabolic enzymes and proteins involved in
   photosynthesis and anthocyanin biosynthesis, sugar is a common
   regulator [[183]32]. It has been shown that sucrose induces anthocyanin
   accumulation and increases the expression of DFR, ANS, and LAR in rice
   and Arabidopsis [[184]19,[185]33].

   It has also been demonstrated that flavonoids confer protection against
   stresses by reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging [[186]34]. Thus,
   the synthesis of secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, in
   response to various environmental factors, such as strong light,
   ultraviolet radiation, high/low temperature, ozone, heavy metals, and
   drought, results in the generation of free radicals. One of the main
   functions of flavonoids is to attenuate effects caused by ROS
   [[187]35,[188]36]. In pigmented rice, the antioxidant capacity of the
   caryopsis is mainly derived from the pericarp, while very few
   differences exist in the endosperm compared to white rice [[189]19].
   This antioxidant effect is mainly derived from flavonoid synthesis. In
   dicotyledonous species, flavone formation is primarily catalyzed by
   cytochrome P450 enzymes [[190]37]. Cytochrome P450 93G1 in rice has
   been shown to regulate flavone synthase [[191]38]. Accumulations of
   epigallocatechin, quercetin, and other flavonoids are elevated by
   pathogen infection [[192]39]. Therefore, we speculate that significant
   differences in flavonoid contents and types among the different
   pigmented rice cultivars are also the result of biotic factors.

   Genotypic analysis of 32 genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis
   pathway revealed 232 SNPs in four genes in the different rice
   cultivars. It is reasonable to speculate that color and the high
   expression of flavonoid components are derived from these genes.
   Additionally, base changes in these four genes (Os06G0162500,
   Os09G0455500, Os09G0455500, and Os10G0536400) directly influenced the
   gene expression of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, leading to high
   contents of flavonoid compounds in pigmented rice in contrast to white
   rice, as these are key genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. For
   example, one SNP was located on chromosome 12 with coordinates of
   768036, which was annotated with a nonsynonymous mutation. In white
   rice, its genotype was pure A, while in pigmented rice, its genotype
   was heterozygous GA. According to the qRT-PCR experiment, the
   corresponding FLS gene (Os12G0115700) expressed in pigmented rice was
   significantly higher than that in white rice. This suggests that
   nonsynonymous mutation may indeed affect the expression of key genes.
   However, further study is required to conclusively demonstrate that
   increased flavonoid contents are directly derived from SNPs in these
   genes.

   Transcriptional regulation of structural genes for the flavonoid
   biosynthesis pathway is controlled by MYB and bHLH transcription
   factors as well as WD40 proteins [[193]40]. Coexpression network
   analyses revealed that these transcriptional factors also regulated
   flavonoid biosynthesis by interacting with other pathways such as
   photosynthesis, sugar synthesis, and peroxidases. It has been reported
   that Rc encodes a bHLH protein involved in red caryopsis production,
   and a 14-bp deletion in Rc changes the caryopsis color to white
   [[194]41]. In maize, different tissue-specific patterns of anthocyanin
   accumulation are derived from divergent controlling elements such as
   promoters and untranslated regions (UTRs) [[195]42,[196]43]. In morning
   glories Ipomoea purpurea and Ipomoea tricolor, a mutant of bHLH2 and
   IVS (IVORY SEED) affects the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and the
   accumulation of proanthocyanins [[197]44]. However, there is no report
   on whether the contents and types of flavonoids, and coloration
   differences among different rice cultivars, are related to the
   expression levels of transcription factors. Our study showed that
   transcription factors did not differ significantly in expression among
   the different rice cultivars, whereas the downstream genes involved in
   the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway showed significant differences. This
   corroborates with an earlier report by Chen [[198]19]. Therefore, it is
   reasonable to conclude that while transcription factors regulate
   flavonoid biosynthesis, the differences in contents and types of
   flavonoids among the different pigmented rice cultivars are due to
   changes in sequence differences, including the promoter region, UTR,
   and conserved domain of key genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis.

   Anthocyanins, proanthocyanins, and other flavonoid components are
   produced via the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, and the majority of
   regulatory genes in rice have been identified by gene cloning and
   homology analyses [[199]45,[200]46,[201]47,[202]48]. A comparative
   study between different pigmented cultivars of the same species
   revealed that upstream genes (CHS and CHI) of the flavonoid
   biosynthesis pathway are expressed at similar levels in cauliflower and
   rice. However, downstream genes (F3′H, DFR, ANS, and LAR) of this
   pathway exhibit significantly different expression levels
   [[203]4,[204]49]. AN1 and AN4, the genes encoding MYB transcription
   factors, activate the bHLH transcription factor of AN1 in Petunia
   [[205]50]. Pr and bHLH1 coordinately regulate several transcripts of
   anthocyanin late pathway genes to control pigment accumulation in
   cauliflower [[206]49]. Coloration mechanisms of a plant depend on three
   different types of proteins, namely a color-producing protein, an
   anthocyanin biosynthesis activator, and a tissue-specific pigmentation
   protein [[207]51,[208]52]. Purple or black are related to the
   rearrangement in the promoter region of Kala1, whereas a red pericarp
   is produced by bHLH and DFR, and a brown pericarp is formed without the
   participation of DFR [[209]41,[210]47]. This study corroborates the
   results of earlier studies [[211]4,[212]49]. Based on gene expression
   validation by qRT-PCR, we speculated that the primary reason for the
   difference in flavonoid composition between black rice and red rice was
   related to DEGs in the flavonoid pathway. For example, three
   anthocyanin synthetase genes were detected. Comparisons of the
   different cultivars showed that one particular gene was highly
   expressed in black rice, while the expression of genes associated with
   anthocyanin synthesis in red rice was relatively low. This was why
   anthocyanin content in black rice was significantly higher than in red
   rice. In addition, proanthocyanidin content in red rice was higher than
   in black rice. Enrichment analysis indicated that one of the genes
   involved in proanthocyanidin synthesis was significantly enriched in
   red rice in comparison to black rice. Further analysis revealed that
   several genes were associated with each enzyme, and one or two genes
   with particularly high expression levels were present in different
   colored caryopses. Thus, differences existed between major gene effects
   and minor gene effects, and differences between black rice and red rice
   could mainly be attributed to differences in major genes. This further
   confirms transcriptome analysis results, that the differences in
   flavonoid compositions between red rice and black rice are due to
   differences in major genes.

   Furthermore, this study revealed a novel mechanism based on
   physiological dynamics, in which differences in coloration, flavonoid
   content, and type among the different rice cultivars are related to
   differential expression levels of the main structural genes and a few
   minor effect genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. This then leads
   to differences in the expression of flavonoids such as anthocyanin,
   catechin, and quercetin.

   In conclusion, this integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of
   different rice cultivars indicates the existence of important and
   dynamic physiological factors that govern flavonoid biosynthesis. It
   offers a foundation for the breeding of elite rice cultivars with
   enhanced natural and biologically active compounds for humans.

4. Materials and Methods

4.1. Plant Material

   The following indica rice (O. sativa) lines were used for the
   transcriptomic and proteomic profiling: these lines were breed by
   Sichuan, China, the red rice cultivar “Hongnuo,” the black rice
   cultivar “Lianjian33,” and the white rice cultivar “Yixiang B”
   ([213]Supplementary Figure S3). Rice plants were cultivated in a paddy
   field from April to September 2016 in Wenjiang District (latitude
   30°429 N, longitude 103°509 E, altitude 539.3 m), Chengdu City, Sichuan
   Province, China. For each sample, at least 50 plants were cultivated,
   and two independent biological replicates were processed. Caryopsis of
   all cultivars were collected 5 days after flowering for RNA extraction
   and iTRAQ protein analysis. In addition, pericarp and endosperm from
   black rice were collected, also at 5 days after flowering, for RNA
   extraction.

4.2. RNA Isolation and Library Preparation for Transcriptome Analysis

   Total RNA was extracted from the caryopsis (along with the pericarp and
   endosperm of black rice) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
   CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the
   extraction method of Kim [[214]53]. The library was prepared as
   follows: for RNA sample preparation, we used 3 µg RNA per sample as
   input. NEBNext^® Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina^® (NEB,
   Ipswich, MA, USA) was used for sequencing libraries following the
   manufacturer’s protocol, and index codes were added to attribute each
   sample sequence. Magnetic beads of poly-T oligo-attached were used to
   purify the mRNA from total RNA. cDNA strands were first synthesized via
   random hexamer primer and MuLV Reverse Transcriptase and second via DNA
   polymerase I and RNase H. An AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter,
   Beverly, Kraemer Boulevard Brea, CA, USA) was used to purify the
   fragments, which were used to increase sections of cDNA fragments by
   150–200 bp. After that, 3 µL USER (Uracil-specific Excision Reagent,
   NEB) enzymes was added to adaptor-ligated cDNA for 15 min at 37 °C and
   followed by 5 min at 95 °C prior to PCR. Then, PCR was performed with
   universal PCR primers, index(X) primer, and with high-fidelity DNA
   polymerase. The quality of purified PCR products was checked on an
   Aglient Bioanalyzer 2100 system. Library preparations were sequenced on
   the Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform, and 150-bp paired-end reads were
   generated. The raw files (FASTQ format) can be accessed from the NCBI
   Sequence Read Archive (SRA) platform
   ([215]https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi) under the
   accession number SRA719903.

4.3. Transcriptome Analysis

   RNA-Seq raw reads were quality controlled and cleaned by SOAPnuke
   software ([216]http://www.seq500.com/uploadfile/SOAPnuke.zip) to remove
   low-quality reads, contaminated reads, and reads with adapters. The
   resulting clean reads were then aligned to the rice IRGSP database
   ([217]http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/pub/data/Eukaryotic_Projects/o_s
   ativa/annotation_dbs/pseudomolecules/version_7.0/) and matched with
   rice genes by HISAT2 [[218]53]. After the number of reads mapped to
   each gene was counted, the FPKM (fragments per kilobase per million
   fragments) method was used for normalization through (RNA-Seq by
   Expectation Maximization) RSEM [[219]54]
   ([220]https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/), and the lowly expressed genes
   (FPKM < 1) were filtered in each sample. NOIseq [[221]55] was employed
   to calculate the log 2-fold change (log2FC) and probability value for
   each gene in every comparison, and strict criterion were used (log2FC >
   1 or log2FC < −1, probability > 0.8). Mapman software was used for
   PageMan analysis [[222]56], and we defined the threshold of significant
   enrichment term as p < 0.01. ANNOVAR software was used for SNP
   functional annotation with the parameter: protocol refGene—operation g.

4.4. Protein Preparation

   Proteins were extracted from mature caryopses (5 g), as previously
   described [[223]56]. Briefly, caryopses were ground in liquid nitrogen
   and homogenized using buffer A (500 mM Tris-HCl/L pH 7.5, 50 mM EDTA,
   100 mM KCl, 700 mM sucrose, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 1× protease
   inhibitor, and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) with 180
   W ultrasonication for 10 min on ice. Then, buffer B (Tris-HCl pH 7.5
   saturated phenols) was added to the sample at a rate of equal volume,
   placed on ice for 3 min to get a homogenized mixture, and subjected to
   centrifugation (15,000× g, 10 min). Protein extraction was done from
   the upper organic phase using buffer A and followed by chilled buffer C
   for protein precipitation at −20 °C overnight. Then, the sample was
   subjected to centrifugation, followed by washing thrice using chilled
   buffer C and two times with chilled acetone.

   Then, the protein samples were suspended in solubilizing buffer (7 M
   urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mM PMSF, and 2
   mM EDTA) followed by sonication at 4 °C (pulse-on 2 s, pulse-off 3 s,
   power 180 W). Then, the samples were centrifuged at 20,000× g for 30
   min and condensed in dithiothreitol (DTT; 10mM) for 60 min at 55 °C.
   After reduction, the samples were alkylated by iodoacetate (55 mM) for
   60 min in the dark, precipitated in chilled acetone (4 × volume) at −20
   °C overnight, followed by centrifugation at 20,000× g for 30 min at 4
   °C. The pellet was dissolved in 400 μL of 0.5 M TEAB (Applied
   Biosystems, Milan, Italy) and sonicated at 4 °C for 3 min. The
   dissolved pallet was subjected to centrifugation at 20,000× g for 30
   min at 4°C, the supernatant was collected, and protein concentration
   was determined by the Bradford assay.

4.5. iTRAQ Labeling, Strong Sation Exchnge Chromatography (SCX)
Fractionation, and Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Tandem Mass
Spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) Analysis

   Proteins (100 μg) of each sample were digested using Trypsin Gold
   (Promega, [224]https://www.promega.com.cn/, Germany) at 37 °C for 16 h
   (protein: trypsin = 30:1). Then, the peptides were dried by vacuum
   centrifugation, reconstituted in 0.5 M TEAB, and processed with 6-plex
   iTRAQ labeling reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
   samples were labeled by the iTRAQ tags as follows: black rice 1 (114),
   black rice 2 (115), red rice 1 (117), red rice 2 (118), white rice 1
   (119), and white rice 2 (121). After the peptides were labeled with
   isobaric tags and incubated at room temperature for 2 h, they were
   pooled and subsequently dried by vacuum centrifugation. Chromatography
   was performed by an Ultramate 3000 nano ultra-performance (UP)LC with a
   C18 column, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was performed by a Q
   Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
   Germany), as previously described [[225]57]. iTRAQ proteomics analysis
   was performed twice for all samples.

4.6. Proteome Data Analysis

   The raw data files generated by Orbitrap were converted to mascot
   generic format (MGF) by Proteome Discoverer 1.2 (Thermo Fisher
   Scientific). These MGF files were subjected to search against proteins
   in rice
   ([226]http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/pub/data/Eukaryotic_Projects/o_s
   ativa/annotation_dbs/pseudomolecules/version_7.0/all.dir/all.pep) by
   Mascot v2.3.02 (Matrix Science). To identify and quantify the proteins
   in the rice grains, the following parameters were used: iTRAQ 8-plex;
   enzyme: trypsin; fixed modification: carbamidomethyl (C), iTRAQ 8-plex
   (N-term), and iTRAQ 8-plex (K); variable modifications: dioxidation
   (M), oxidation (M), and iTRAQ 8-plex (Y); mass values: monoisotopic;
   peptide mass tolerance: ± 15 ppm; fragment mass tolerance: ± 20 mmu;
   max missed cleavages: 1; and charge states of peptides: +2 and +3.

   The decoy checkbox was selected in Mascot for an automatic decoy
   database search, which generated a random sequence database. The random
   sequence database and real database were tested to get raw spectra.
   Peptides with a significant score of ≥20 at the 99% confidence
   interval, for Mascot probability analysis greater than “identity”, were
   counted as identified, which reduced false peptide probability. Each
   confident protein identification was associated with at least one
   unique peptide. The iTRAQ proteomics analysis was performed twice, and
   differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified with a fold
   change of >1.5 (p < 0.05) or <0.67 (p < 0.05).

   To analyze the potential functions of the proteins, we first
   reannotated the rice proteins. Briefly, rice proteins were mapped to
   multiple public databases, including the NCBI nonredundant (NR),
   Swiss-Prot/UniProt, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
   and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Using all the proteins as background, we
   used the numbers of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) to
   calculate the p-value and Q-value, which represented the significance
   of the enriched GO terms/KEGG pathways and the false discovery rate
   (FDR), respectively. The p-values were calculated by Fisher’s exact
   test, and the Q-values were calculated by an R package named “q-value”
   [[227]58]. The threshold of significance was defined as FDR < 0.05.

4.7. Gene Coexpression Network Analysis

   The “GeneNet” package was used to construct gene coexpression networks
   [[228]59]. This method used partial correlation to calculate the link
   between two genes and had the advantage of not requiring any parameters
   (with the exception of the correlation threshold used to select the
   most relevant edges). Coexpression network analyses were constructed
   for the regulation between photosynthesis and flavonoids, between
   sugars and flavonoids, between phenylalanine and flavonoids, between
   peroxide and flavonoids, between MYB and flavonoids, and between bHLH
   and flavonoids. We displayed the top 150 largest absolute correlations,
   and the graph was generated using the “ggplot2” package [[229]60].

4.8. qRT-PCR Analysis

   qRT-PCR was performed using a qTOWER^3G Real-Time System
   (Analytik-Jena, Germany), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
   All reactions were performed with a ChamQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master
   Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
   The housekeeping gene GAPDH was used as the internal control. The
   sequences of the primers are indicated in [230]Supplementary Table S11.

4.9. Statistical Analysis

   All transcriptional and proteomic samples were designed for two
   biological replicates. To identify the DEGs, NOIseq was used to
   calculate the log 2-fold change (log2FC) and probability for each gene
   in every comparison, and a strict criterion was used (log2FC > 1 or
   log2FC < −1, probability > 0.8). We performed iTRAQ proteomics analyses
   four times, and the DEPs were identified if the ratio was >1.5 and the
   p-value (t-test) was <0.05. Fisher’s exact test and the Q-values were
   calculated by an R package in the GO and pathway enrichment analysis,
   and an FDR less than 0.05 constituted the significance threshold.
