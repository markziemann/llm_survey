Here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis as described in the provided text, formatted for a table:

| **Question** | **Answer** |
|---|---|
| 1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | DAVID |
| 2. Was a tool version number provided? | Not described |
| 3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)? | Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway databases |
| 4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis? | Yes, the categories of KEGG Pathways served as the background databases. |
| 5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis? | Chi-squared test (used to assess breakpoint distribution in gene element regions â€“ this *implies* use in pathway analysis as well, though not explicitly stated) |
| 6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis? | Not described |
