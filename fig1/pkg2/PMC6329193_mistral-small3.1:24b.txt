   proteins, and H2O2, were determined. (225) the extent of lipid peroxidation, carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism and
   (0.15 g) were homogenized in 1 mL of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 10% (w/v) and 50 mM EDTA and 10%
   proline assay kits were used following the manufacturer’s protocol (226). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10 min at 4°C and 12000 g and the homogenate was centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min
   the 4°C. The supernatants were collected for subsequent
   measurements. The MDA, soluble protein, soluble sugar, and proline contents were determined.

   (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) were used to sequence reads to the
   samples. Three biological replications the PCR products were removed by AMPure XP-beads. The 229 MB were performed. The first-strand cDNA
   were synthesized using M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H^−) and DNA
   Polymerase I. The second-strand cDNA were synthesized by DNA polymerase I and
   RNase H. Then, the double-stranded cDNA was performed. The purified double-stranded
   DNA were amplified by PCR, and purified again by AMPure XP-beads. The
   final cDNA library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500, CA, USA) platform and the sequenced cDNA were
   the cDNA were subjected to a Qubit system and Qubit®
   RNA samples were carried out on the Agilent High-Sensitivity DNA chip
   (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA), and Illumina cDNA
   according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After the clustering, the samples were
   performed on the HiSeq 4000, CA, USA) platform and sequenced by
   paired-end RNA-Seq 100 samples were conducted. Three biological replicates were performed for each
   sample. A Phred quality score (Q20) of 150 bp paired-end reads on the
   20000 platform (Illumina, CA, USA) and quality control were performed.
   The raw reads in FASTQ format were performed through the quality
   scripts. The clean reads were obtained by removing reads with adaptor
   sequences and poly-N and low-quality reads with Q20) quality bases using FastQC. The high-quality clean data were conducted for
   further analysis.

   performed on the reference genome sequences and were aligned to the reference
   genome. The aligned reads were aligned by Hisat2 v2.1.1.0
   were downloaded from the NCBI database (https://www.cottongen.org). The aligned sequences were generated by using the HISAT2 (v2.1.0) were performed by Bowtie2.3 and aligned using the TopHat v2.0.12 to the genome sequences using Bowtie v2.2.3.0 (Illumina, CA,
   USA) platform) were aligned. The FPKM of each gene was calculated and the fragments per kilobase of
   exon models were calculated. The FPKM values were normalized to
   determine the read counts for each gene was obtained. The FPKM values were calculated. A
   on the length of the gene and read counts mapped to this gene.

   The DEGs were determined as genes with an absolute fold change ≥2.0 and
   an adjusted P-value <0.05 and gene length for
   length on the FPKM values. The differentially expressed genes were
   screened and identified by the DESeq R package (v1.18.0) was used for differential
   expression analysis of the two samples (infected and uninfected). The
   for determining the DEGs of genes
   between the two samples. The Benjamini-Hochberg and the
   procedure was employed to correct for the multiple tests. The
   approach and the false discovery rate was controlled for the multiple

   The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of the DEGs identified by the topGO
   and the KOBAS v3.0 and 0.05. The GOseq software
   test the statistical enrichment of the DEGs in the KEGG pathways and the
   of the different materials.
