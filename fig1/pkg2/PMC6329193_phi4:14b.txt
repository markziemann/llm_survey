Based on the provided text, here is an examination of how pathway enrichment analysis was conducted in this scientific article:

1. **Tool Used for Pathway Enrichment Analysis:**
   - The tool used for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis is the GOseq R package.
   - For Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, KOBAS software was utilized.

2. **Tool Version Number Provided:**
   - The version number for the DESeq R package is provided as v1.18.0.
   - No specific versions are mentioned for GOseq or KOBAS in the text provided.

3. **Gene Set Library Queried:**
   - For GO enrichment, a Gene Ontology (GO) gene set library was queried.
   - For pathway analysis, the KEGG pathways were queried using KOBAS software.

4. **Background Gene List Defined for Pathway Enrichment Analysis:**
   - The text does not explicitly mention the definition of a background gene list for pathway enrichment analysis. It is generally implied that the entire reference genome or transcriptome could be used as a background, but this detail is not described in the excerpt.

5. **Statistical Test Used for Enrichment Analysis:**
   - For GO enrichment, a statistical test using corrected P-values (P-value ≤ 0.5) was employed.
   - The specific statistical test for KOBAS pathway analysis is not detailed, but typically, enrichment tools like these use hypergeometric or similar tests.

6. **False Discovery Rate Correction Used:**
   - For DEG identification using the DESeq package, Benjamini and Hochberg’s method was used to adjust P-values for false discovery rate (FDR) control.
   - For GO enrichment analysis, corrected P-values were utilized, indicating some form of FDR correction.

Here's how this information can be collated into a table format:

| Question | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Tool Used for Pathway Enrichment Analysis | GOseq R package (GO), KOBAS software (KEGG) |
| Tool Version Number Provided | DESeq v1.18.0; no specific versions mentioned for GOseq or KOBAS |
| Gene Set Library Queried | GO (Gene Ontology), KEGG pathways |
| Background Gene List Defined | Not described |
| Statistical Test Used for Enrichment Analysis | Corrected P-value ≤ 0.5 for GO; not specified for KEGG |
| False Discovery Rate Correction Used | Benjamini and Hochberg’s method for DESeq, corrected P-values used in GO |

If more details are required or specific sections of the article need further examination, additional context from the full text would be needed.
