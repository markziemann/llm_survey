Abstract

Objective

   Onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) occurs in childhood for approximately
   5% of cases (pediatric MS, or ped‐MS). Epigenetic influences are
   strongly implicated in MS pathogenesis in adults, including the
   contribution from microRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNAs that affect
   gene expression by binding target gene mRNAs. Few studies have
   specifically examined miRNAs in ped‐MS, but individuals developing MS
   at an early age may carry a relatively high burden of genetic risk
   factors, and miRNA dysregulation may therefore play a larger role in
   the development of ped‐MS than in adult‐onset MS. This study aimed to
   look for evidence of miRNA involvement in ped‐MS pathogenesis.

Methods

   GWAS results from 486 ped‐MS cases and 1362 controls from the U.S.
   Pediatric MS Network and Kaiser Permanente Northern California
   membership were investigated for miRNA‐specific signals. First,
   enrichment of miRNA‐target gene network signals was evaluated using
   MIGWAS software. Second, SNPs in miRNA genes and in target gene binding
   sites (miR−SNPs) were tested for association with ped‐MS, and pathway
   analysis was performed on associated target genes.

Results

   MIGWAS analysis showed that miRNA‐target gene signals were enriched in
   GWAS (P = 0.038) and identified 39 candidate biomarker miRNA‐target
   gene pairs, including immune and neuronal signaling genes. The miR‐SNP
   analysis implicated dysregulation of miRNA binding to target genes in
   five pathways, mainly involved in immune signaling.

Interpretation

   Evidence from GWAS suggests that miRNAs play a role in ped‐MS
   pathogenesis by affecting immune signaling and other pathways.
   Candidate biomarker miRNA‐target gene pairs should be further studied
   for diagnostic, prognostic, and/or therapeutic utility.

Introduction

   Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune‐mediated demyelinating disease of
   the central nervous system and a leading cause of neurological
   disability in young adults. MS is typically diagnosed between the ages
   of 20 and 40, but it is estimated that up to 5% of all cases experience
   their first symptoms before the age of 18.[85]1, [86]2 While
   pediatric‐onset MS (ped‐MS) and adult MS presentation largely overlap,
   disease course in children is almost exclusively relapsing‐remitting,
   with a higher relapse rate, and a longer time to development of
   secondary progressive MS and disability.[87]2, [88]3, [89]4

   MS is thought to result from a complex interplay of genetic,
   epigenetic, and environmental risk factors.[90]5 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are
   epigenetic factors that have been investigated in MS, and over 170
   miRNAs have been found to be differentially expressed in various
   tissues in either adult‐onset MS or experimental autoimmune
   encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice.[91]6, [92]7, [93]8, [94]9, [95]10,
   [96]11, [97]12, [98]13 One study specifically compared miRNA expression
   levels in ped‐MS cases to pediatric controls, and 12 upregulated and
   one downregulated miRNA were reported.[99]14 miRNAs are short (~22
   nucleotides) noncoding RNAs that usually downregulate gene expression
   by binding to specific sequences of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts,
   targeting them for degradation and blocking protein translation, though
   different miRNA functions have also been reported.[100]15 Target sites
   generally lie in the 3’ untranslated regions (3’ UTRs) of mRNAs, but
   binding in other regions is known to occur.[101]16 Because each miRNA
   can target hundreds of genes, and any gene can be regulated by multiple
   miRNAs, they have the potential to influence entire networks of genes
   at once.

   Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and around miRNA genes have
   been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, including
   MS.[102]17 These miRNA SNPs can disrupt normal gene regulatory
   functions by affecting miRNA expression levels and processing, but SNPs
   in the target‐binding sites of mRNAs can also impact the normal
   function of miRNAs. Strategies to examine target gene SNPs in addition
   to miRNA gene SNPs have recently been developed and have implicated
   specific miRNAs and target genes in the development of autoimmune and
   other diseases.[103]18, [104]19, [105]20, [106]21

   This study examined evidence of miRNA involvement in ped‐MS
   susceptibility in two ways. First, genome‐wide association study (GWAS)
   results were tested for enrichment of signals in miRNA‐target gene
   networks utilizing MIGWAS software.[107]21, [108]22 Second, a miR‐SNP
   association study was performed, and pathway analysis was used to
   characterize target genes harboring miR‐SNPs associated with ped‐MS. We
   define miR‐SNP as a SNP that is either (1) located in a gene that codes
   for a miRNA, or (2) located in a miRNA‐binding site of a target gene.

Methods

Study participants

   The study participants have been previously described,[109]23 but now
   include additional ped‐MS cases with same inclusion/exclusion criteria.
   Additionally, only participants who were genotyped using an Illumina
   BeadChip array were included in this study. Briefly, patients with
   onset of MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with two silent MRI
   lesions suggestive of early MS before the age of 18 (n = 432) were
   enrolled through the U.S. Network of Pediatric MS Centers.[110]3
   Additional adult cases with onset prior to age 18 (n = 68) were
   recruited retrospectively from the Kaiser Permanente Northern
   California (KPNC) membership. All cases were confirmed to have MS using
   established diagnostic criteria.[111]24, [112]25

   Pediatric controls (n = 208) were enrolled through the U.S. Network of
   Pediatric MS Centers.[113]3 Adult controls (n = 894) without a
   diagnosis of MS, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, or demyelinating
   disease confirmed through electronic medical records were recruited
   from KPNC and enrolled. A second set of previously described[114]26
   female adult controls (n = 268) with no prior history of autoimmune
   disease who were recruited as part of the University of California San
   Francisco Mother‐Child Immunogenetic Study were also included.

Data collection

   DNA from participants was purified from either whole blood or saliva
   samples. Genotyping was performed using Illumina Infinium 660K and
   Human Omni Express BeadChip arrays. Genotype data were merged into a
   single dataset and processed using PLINK 1.9.[115]27 SNPs with a minor
   allele frequency (MAF) <1% or success rate <90% and samples with >10%
   failed genotype calls were removed from analysis. To reduce confounding
   due to population stratification, analyses were restricted to white
   individuals, defined as having >=80% European ancestry identified using
   SNP weights for European, West African, East Asian, and Native American
   ancestral populations.[116]28 Related individuals were identified, and
   only one randomly chosen person in any related group was retained for
   analysis, with the exception that cases were preferentially retained in
   instances where cases and controls were related. Classical
   multidimensional scaling (MDS) was used to visualize study population
   ancestry (Figure [117]S1) and include as covariates in subsequent
   statistical analyses. Five outlier samples were removed from analysis.
   SNP imputation was performed with reference haplotypes from Phase 3 of
   the 1000 Genomes Project[118]29 using SHAPEIT2 and IMPUTE2.[119]30
   Genotypes were called using the default hard‐call threshold of 90%
   using PLINK. Imputed SNPs with info score <0.3, with MAF <1%, with
   genotype call rate <90%, or not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)
   among controls (P < 0.00001) were removed. The final imputed dataset
   consisted of 7 570 644 autosomal SNPs, of which 42 277 lay within the
   major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region chr6:29570005‐33377657 in
   GRCh37/hg19, spanning genes GABBR1 to KIFC1.[120]31 Presence of the
   HLA‐DRB1*15:01 allele, the strongest genetic risk factor for MS, was
   determined for each participant using the tag SNP rs3135388.[121]32
   There were 486 cases and 1362 controls in the final dataset. Study
   protocols were approved by all institutions, and informed consent or
   assent was obtained from all participants, as previously
   described.[122]23

Statistical analyses—miRNA‐target gene network enrichment in GWAS (MIGWAS)

   Genome‐wide association tests were performed on all autosomal SNPs
   outside of the MHC using logistic regression and additive genetic
   models in PLINK. Models included the first three MDS components to
   adjust for residual confounding by population stratification.
   Enrichment of miRNA‐target gene network signals in the GWAS results was
   evaluated using MIGWAS software.[123]21, [124]22 Briefly, MIGWAS takes
   GWAS P‐values as input, selects the lowest P‐value per miRNA and target
   gene, and, for each of 179 different tissues with available miRNA
   expression data from FANTOM5,[125]33 identifies the number of
   miRNA‐target gene pairs that satisfy the following conditions: both the
   miRNA and the target gene are associated with the outcome (P < 0.01),
   there is a high binding score prediction for the pair, and the miRNA is
   highly and specifically expressed in the tissue. Enrichment of
   miRNA‐target gene signal is estimated by permuting GWAS P‐values 20 000
   times and recomputing the number of miRNA‐target gene pairs that
   satisfy the conditions to obtain an empirical null distribution of that
   number. A P‐value for enrichment is then reported for each tissue, as
   well as an overall enrichment P‐value that does not take tissue
   expression into consideration is also reported. Enrichment P‐values of
   0.05 or lower were considered significant. Candidate biomarker
   miRNA‐target gene pairs are also reported, and are defined as pairs
   where both the miRNA and target gene are nominally associated with the
   outcome (P < 0.01) and the miRNA‐target gene binding prediction score
   is in the top one percentile of all pairs.[126]22

Statistical analyses—miR‐SNP association

   miR‐SNPs were tested separately for association with ped‐MS. miR‐SNPs
   in miRNA genes were identified using version 21 high‐confidence
   annotations from the miRBase database.[127]34 Coordinates for 1877
   miRNA genes were converted from build 38 to build 37 using the UCSC
   Genome Browser liftOver tool[128]35 and intersected with imputed SNPs
   in the ped‐MS dataset using BEDTools,[129]36 resulting in 267 miR‐SNPs
   outside of the MHC and 8 within the MHC. miR‐SNPs in predicted
   target‐binding sites in the 3’ UTRs of protein‐coding genes were
   identified using the MirSNP database[130]18 and version 3.0 of the
   PolymiRTS database.[131]19 SNPs in predicted target regions from either
   database were intersected with the ped‐MS dataset, resulting in 51 725
   target region miR‐SNPs outside of the MHC and 586 miR‐SNPs within the
   MHC.

   Each miR‐SNP was tested for association with ped‐MS using the same
   logistic regression models as in the GWAS analysis, with the exception
   that models for miR‐SNPs within the MHC also included the
   HLA‐DRB1*15:01 tag SNP as a covariate. P‐values in each category of
   association tests—miRNA gene SNPs or target gene SNPs, within or
   outside of the MHC—were adjusted separately for multiple hypothesis
   testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to control the false
   discovery rate.[132]37 A threshold of 0.05 was used to determine
   significance. In an effort to reduce the statistical burden of multiple
   hypothesis tests, several sets of candidate mir‐SNPs were considered
   separately: 897 miR‐SNPs in the 3'UTRs of genes proximal to 200 non‐MHC
   loci identified in the latest adult‐onset MS genome‐wide association
   study;[133]38 1063 miR‐SNPs experimentally supported by crosslinking,
   ligation, and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH) experiments, including in
   noncanonical binding sites and nonprotein‐coding genes;[134]16 19 516
   miR‐SNPs predicted in the polymiRTS database to either create a new
   miRNA‐binding site or disrupt a conserved miRNA‐binding site, with a
   context+ score difference of less than −0.15 (more negative scores
   indicate increased confidence that miRNA binding is disrupted); and one
   miR‐SNP in the 3’ UTR of the HLA‐DRB1 gene.

   Pathway analysis of target genes with mir‐SNPs that was nominally
   associated with ped‐MS at P < 0.01 in the main association analysis was
   conducted using PANTHER.[135]39 Statistical overrepresentation tests
   were performed using a background list of only protein‐coding genes.
   Each of nine available annotation datasets in the “PANTHER,” “GO,” and
   “Reactome” pathways were tested using Fisher's Exact test with FDR
   multiple test correction.

Results

   Characteristics of study participants are summarized in Table [136]1.
   Average age of onset for ped‐MS cases was 14.3 years, and cases had
   more copies of the HLA‐DRB1*15:01 allele than controls, as expected.
   When plotted with HGDP reference populations, cases, and controls
   clustered together near European individuals (Figure [137]S1).

miRNA‐target gene network enrichment in GWAS (MIGWAS)

   Enrichment of miRNA‐target gene network signals was observed in the
   ped‐MS GWAS results for 25 different tissues (P < 0.05) as well as
   overall, without considering tissue‐specific miRNA expression
   (P = 0.038). Results are summarized in Table [139]2. MIGWAS identified
   39 candidate biomarker miRNA‐target gene pairs comprised of 16 unique
   miRNAs and 37 unique genes (Table [140]3).

   P‐values and fold changes are for enrichment of the number of
   miRNA‐target gene pairs associated with ped‐MS (where the pair has a
   high predicted binding score and the miRNA is highly expressed in the
   tissue) compared to the empirical null distribution of the number of

miR‐SNP association

   After adjusting P‐values for multiple hypothesis testing, no miR‐SNPs
   were significantly associated with ped‐MS in the genome‐wide analyses
   at FDR < 0.05. There were 255 target genes with 3’ UTR miR‐SNPs
   associated at P < 0.01 in the genome‐wide analysis that were used as
   input for pathway analyses. These genes were overrepresented in five
   pathways in PANTHER (Table [153]4). Among the candidate miR‐SNP sets,
   only one CLASH‐supported miR‐SNP, rs61075345 in the third exon of
   TVP23B, was associated with ped‐MS (P = 4.59 × 10^−05, FDR = 0.047).

Discussion

   In this study, evidence that miRNAs are involved in ped‐MS pathogenesis
   was sought using two different approaches that utilized genetic data
   from the largest population of ped‐MS cases gathered to date.

   The MIGWAS method identified enrichment of miRNA‐target gene networks
   in ped‐MS GWAS results, and identified tissues in which miRNAs involved
   in those networks are known to be highly expressed. Tissues included
   gastrointestinal, brain, fetal, fat, joint, immune, lung, vascular,
   skin, kidney, and other tissues (Table [155]2). While it is true that
   immune and central nervous system tissues have clear roles in MS and
   are generally prioritized first for study, there is evidence that
   processes starting in other tissues may play a role in triggering MS
   and also warrant investigation. For instance, smoking is hypothesized
   to exert its effect on MS risk primarily through irritation and
   inflammation of lung tissue, which in turn likely trigger (possibly
   autoreactive) immune responses.[156]5 The highest enrichment observed
   in this ped‐MS study was in a gastrointestinal tissue, keratinized
   cells of the oral mucosa, and gastrointestinal tissues were
   overrepresented in these results: four of the seven gastrointestinal
   tissues tested were enriched for miRNA‐target gene network signals.
   Evidence that miRNA dysregulation could specifically be occurring in
   gastrointestinal tissues is notable because there is existing evidence
   of a bidirectional relationship between MS and the gut microbiome,
   where aberrant gut microbiomes found in MS patients contribute to a
   proinflammatory state, and the autoreactive immune systems of MS
   patients shape the gut microbiome.[157]40

   Several genes identified in the MIGWAS candidate biomarker target‐gene
   pairs are involved in immune signaling and activation (Table [158]3)
   according to RefSeq annotations,[159]41 and are therefore particularly
   promising targets of future research into the role miRNAs play in
   ped‐MS development. CIITA is a “master regulator” of class II HLA gene
   expression, and CD80 is a T‐cell membrane receptor that provides the
   costimulatory signal necessary for T‐cell activation. CD109 is
   expressed in activated T cells and regulates transforming growth factor
   beta signaling. CBL is an enzyme required for targeting substrates for
   degradation by the proteasome and is a negative regulator of many
   signaling pathways triggered by activation of cell surface receptors.
   TFAP4 is a transcription factor that activates both viral and cellular
   genes. Two other MIGWAS genes with plausible roles in ped‐MS
   pathogenesis affect neuronal differentiation and signaling. GLIS2 is
   widely expressed at low levels in the neural tube and peripheral
   nervous system and is thought to promote neuronal differentiation, and
   NCS1 modulates synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity and is
   expressed predominantly in neurons. Three genes identified by MIGWAS
   are involved in protein folding and homeostasis in the endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER), which is notable because the ER lumen cellular
   component was also identified in the miR‐SNP pathway analysis. The ER
   lumen is where class I and II HLA proteins are assembled,[160]42 and
   stress in the ER caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins (the
   “unfolded protein response” or UPR) is associated with a number of
   inflammatory diseases, including MS.[161]43 Of the MIGWAS‐identified
   genes, HYOU1 is thought to play an important role in protein folding
   and secretion in the ER. ERP29 localizes to the lumen of the ER and is
   involved in the processing of secretory proteins. SLC37A4 regulates
   transport from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the ER to maintain glucose
   homeostasis and plays a role in calcium sequestration in the ER lumen.
   Collectively, the genes in the 39 miRNA‐target gene pairs suggest that
   miRNAs could be affecting ped‐MS through many mechanisms, including
   immune signaling and activation, neuronal differentiation and
   signaling, and protein folding in the ER. Finally, it is notable that
   expression differences in five of the 16 candidate miRNAs identified by
   MIGWAS, hsa‐mir‐197, hsa‐mir‐200c, hsa‐mir‐21, hsa‐mir‐599, and
   hsa‐mir‐744, have been associated with MS or EAE in previous
   studies,[162]6, [163]7 and two of them, hsa‐miR‐21 and hsa‐miR‐3605,
   were differentially expressed in ped‐MS cases specifically (though
   hsa‐miR‐21 failed a subsequent validation assay).[164]14 A follow‐up to
   the ped‐MS expression study found that six of the 13 confirmed
   ped‐MS‐associated miRNAs were also differentially expressed in
   adults,[165]44 but hsa‐miR‐3605 was not among them, suggesting that it
   could be a biomarker specific to ped‐MS.

   In the miR‐SNP analysis, the single CLASH‐supported miR‐SNP associated
   with ped‐MS resides in the TVP23B gene, which codes for a membrane
   protein associated with diabetic retinopathy.[166]45 It is not
   immediately clear how it may play a role in ped‐MS pathogenesis.
   However, statistical overrepresentation tests of top miR‐SNP hits
   yielded two receptor‐mediated signaling pathways with a more evident
   relationship with ped‐MS. Five genes in the histamine H[1] receptor
   pathway were found to have ped‐MS‐associated miR‐SNPs (Table [167]4).
   Histamine is a ubiquitous compound in human tissues that acts as a
   neurotransmitter and that is involved in inflammatory responses that
   act through four different receptors, H[1]‐H[4]. It is thought that the
   proinflammatory effects of histamine act through H[1] receptors.[168]46
   Many of the same genes are also involved in the 5‐HT[2] type receptor
   mediated signaling pathway. 5‐HT[2] is a subtype of serotonin
   receptors. Similar to histamine, serotonin is a signaling molecule with
   wide‐ranging effects that acts as both a neurotransmitter and a
   hormone. The 5‐HT[2] class of hormone receptors is expressed on several
   immune cell types.[169]47 Our results suggest that dysregulation of
   genes involved in these signaling pathways by miRNAs increases ped‐MS
   risk.

   The other three pathways identified in the miR‐SNP analysis each
   encompass many of the same genes, including several genes encoded in
   the MHC (Table [170]4). Five class I and II HLA genes associated with
   ped‐MS are in the MHC protein complex (GO cellular component). These
   genes code for proteins that present antigens to T cells, and variants
   in antigen‐presenting genes are the first‐documented and strongest
   genetic risk factors for MS.[171]5, [172]38 The same five HLA genes are
   part of the integral component of the luminal side of endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER) membrane (GO Cellular Component). Of note, the genes
   identified in the miR‐SNP analysis are different from those identified
   in the MIGWAS analysis, but both methods point to dysregulation of
   processes in the ER. The interferon gamma (IFN‐γ) signaling pathway
   contains a total of nine ped‐MS‐associated genes. The role of IFN‐γ in
   MS has been extensively studied, and, similar to histamine and
   serotonin, it can have detrimental or beneficial effects on MS
   depending on where and when it is active.[173]48 Our miR‐SNP analysis
   findings indicate that aberrant regulation by miRNAs of genes in the
   MHC protein complex, genes on the inner part of the ER lumen, or genes
   involved in IFN‐γ signaling (which are not mutually exclusive genes),
   could be contributing to ped‐MS pathogenesis.

   This study had some limitations. It is possible that the SNPs
   identified in the MIGWAS and miR‐SNP studies do not affect ped‐MS via
   miRNA function but instead are associated due to linkage disequilibrium
   with SNPs acting by other mechanisms. Another issue is that
   miRNA‐target binding prediction is imperfect, and therefore some of the
   miRNAs may not actually act on the genes identified in MIGWAS, and some
   of the miR‐SNPs tested may not in reality impact miRNA function.
   Because the study was restricted to a white population, results may not
   be generalizable, and miRNA associations that exist in other non‐white
   populations may have been missed.

   An important strength of this study is that it utilized the largest
   study population thus far for ped‐MS, which is a rare disease, and
   therefore difficult to study. Furthermore, cases were ascertained by a
   panel of pediatric MS specialists. Only samples genotyped on Illumina
   microarrays were utilized, minimizing the possibility of imputation
   bias, and rigorous quality control of microarray data was applied. By
   assessing P‐values of SNPs in miRNA and target genes at the same time,
   and by including miRNA expression data, MIGWAS was able to detect
   signals that may be missed with traditional GWAS or miR‐SNP analysis.

   In conclusion, this study provides evidence that ped‐MS risk is
   influenced by miRNAs acting on immune signaling and other genes, and
   several miRNA‐target gene pairs and specific tissues were nominated for
   further study. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results, and
   further work is needed to determine whether any miRNA‐mediated disease
   processes are specific to the pediatric population.
