Here's a breakdown of the pathway/gene enrichment analysis methods, based on the provided text, presented in a format suitable for a table:

**1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**

*   DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery)

**2. Was a tool version number provided?**

*   Yes, version 6.8 is specified.

**3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**

*   Gene Ontology (GO) terms were queried.

**4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**

*   Yes. A list of 10,919 genes reported as expressed in bovine skeletal muscle (from the EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas) was used as the background gene list.

**5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**

*   Not explicitly described in the provided text. The text only states that significance of enriched terms was adjusted.

**6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**

*   Yes, Benjamini-Hochberg p-value correction was used to adjust for multiple testing and control for false positives.
