| Question                                         | Answer                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | Not described                                                             |
| 2. Was a tool version number provided?              | Not described                                                             |
| 3. What gene set library was queried?             | Not described (mentions pathways generally, but doesn't specify the database used) |
| 4. Was a background gene list defined?            | Not described                                                             |
| 5. What statistical test was used?                 | Not described                                                             |
| 6. Was false discovery rate correction used?      | Yes, False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction was used.                      |

**Important Note:** The provided text is quite descriptive in its results and discussion but lacks specific details about *how* the pathway enrichment analysis was performed. The answers above are based *solely* on the information presented in the text. It is clear that the authors performed some form of analysis but did not disclose the methodology in sufficient detail for replication or complete understanding.
