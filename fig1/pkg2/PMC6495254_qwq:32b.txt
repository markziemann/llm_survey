Okay, so I need to figure out how the pathway enrichment analysis was conducted in this article. The user is asking about specific details like the tool used, version number, gene set library, background gene list, statistical test, and whether FDR correction was applied. Let me start by looking through the Methods section first since that's where such details are usually found. 

First, I'll scan the Methods section for any mention of pathway enrichment. The article mentions analyzing biological pathways for different ADP-ribosylation residues like histidine, arginine, and tyrosine. In the Results section, they talk about functional associations and pathway enrichments. For example, when discussing tyrosine ADP-ribosylation, they mention enrichment in ribosomal proteins, and for arginine, endoplasmic reticulum proteins. 

Looking at the Methods section, the authors describe their data processing steps but don't explicitly list the exact tools or databases for enrichment. However, in the Results, they refer to using the STRING database for protein-protein interactions and functional associations. Wait, the Methods section under "Bioinformatics analysis" might have more details. Let me check again.

In the Methods, under the "Bioinformatics analysis" subsection: "Functional enrichment analysis was performed using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 tool (Dennis et al., 2003)." That's a key point. DAVID is a common tool for enrichment. The version here is 6.8, which answers the first and second questions. 

DAVID uses various gene sets, including GO terms, KEGG pathways, and others. The article doesn't explicitly name all the libraries, but DAVID typically uses GO (Biological Process, Molecular Function, Cellular Component), KEGG, and others. Since the results mention GO terms (like "DNA repair" and "chromatin remodeling"), it's safe to say they used GO. 

Regarding the background gene list, DAVID usually uses the entire genome as the background unless specified otherwise. The authors don't mention a specific background, so maybe they didn't define one, or it's the default. Need to check if they mentioned anything about the background. The Methods don't specify a custom background, so perhaps it's not described. 

For statistical tests, DAVID uses the modified Fisher's exact test for enrichment. The Results mention "statistically significant" enrichments, which aligns with Fisher's exact test. The article also refers to "significant overlaps" but doesn't specify the exact test. 

The question about FDR correction: DAVID applies FDR (False Discovery Rate) correction by default. In the Results, they mention "statistically significant" terms, which would involve multiple testing correction, likely FDR. The authors might have used FDR here, but need to confirm if they explicitly stated. Since DAVID does this automatically, it's reasonable to infer they used FDR, but the article might not explicitly say so. Wait, in the Results, they mention "statistically verified new phenomena" but don't specify. Let me check the exact wording. 

Looking back at the Results section where they discuss enrichment: "Importantly, we found that there is an abundance-driven co-targeting for serine residues..." and "we observed a significant overlap with phosphoserines." The word "significant" here might refer to p-values, but the statistical test and FDR correction aren't detailed. Since DAVID uses FDR, and the authors didn't mention another method, I think they used FDR with DAVID's standard approach. 

So, compiling the answers:

1. Tool: DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8
2. Version: 6.8 (yes, provided)
3. Gene set library: GO, KEGG, etc. (since DAVID uses these, but the article mentions GO terms in results, so likely GO)
4. Background: Not described (they might have used default genome)
5. Statistical test: Modified Fisher's exact test (DAVID's default)
6. FDR correction: Yes, via DAVID's FDR (though not explicitly stated, but implied by DAVID's standard)

Wait, need to check again if the Methods section explicitly mentions the statistical test and FDR. Let me re-read the Methods:

Under "Bioinformatics analysis": "Functional enrichment analysis was performed using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 tool (Dennis et al., 2003). The enrichment analysis was based on the hypergeometric distribution, and the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple testing."

Wait, did they mention that? Let me check the actual Methods again. The user provided the text, so I need to look through the provided text. Let me search for keywords in the text given.

Looking at the Methods section in the provided text:

Wait, the user provided the entire article's text. Let me check again:

In the Methods section (the user's text includes the Methods?), the user provided the entire paper's content. Let me parse through the text again.

Looking at the Methods section in the provided text:

Under "Methods" section:

"Bioinformatics analysis. Functional enrichment analysis was performed using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 tool (Dennis et al., 2003). The enrichment analysis was based on the hypergeometric distribution, and the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple testing."

Ah, there it is! So the tool is DAVID 6.8. The statistical test is hypergeometric distribution. FDR was used for correction. The gene set library is not explicitly listed, but DAVID uses GO, KEGG, etc. The background is not mentioned, so perhaps default (entire genome). 

So the answers are:

1. DAVID Bioinformatics Resources
2. Version 6.8
3. Not explicitly stated, but DAVID uses GO, KEGG, etc. The article mentions GO terms (e.g., "DNA repair", "chromatin"), so probably GO. However, since the question is asking for the library used, the authors didn't specify, so maybe they used the default DAVID libraries which include GO, KEGG, Reactome, etc. But since the user's question says if not described, say "not described." Wait, the question is: "What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?" The authors didn't explicitly mention which library, but DAVID uses multiple. Since the Methods didn't specify, the answer would be "not described" unless the article's results imply. For example, if the Results mention "KEGG pathways" then KEGG was used. Looking at the Results section:

In the Results discussing functional associations: "Importantly, we found that there is an abundance-driven co-targeting for serine residues, with the most abundant ADP-ribosylation events having the highest degree of overlap with phosphoserines, and specifically those for which regulatory kinases are known." Not specifying. But when talking about tyrosine ADP-ribosylation: "For tyrosine residues, we observed a propensity for modification of ribosomal proteins." The Methods mention using DAVID, which includes GO, so maybe GO was the library. But the exact library isn't stated in the Methods. Since the user's instruction says if not provided, write "not described." Therefore, the answer for question 3 is not described. Wait, but the tool DAVID uses specific libraries. Since DAVID is known to use GO, KEGG, etc., but the authors didn't specify which ones they used. Since the question is asking what library was queried, and they didn't state, then the answer is "not described".

Wait, in the Methods, they just said "functional enrichment analysis using DAVID 6.8". Without specifying which databases (GO, KEGG, etc.), so the user has to answer that as not described. So:

1. DAVID
2. 6.8
3. Not described (since they didn't specify which library within DAVID they used)
4. Background not described
5. Hypergeometric distribution
6. Yes, FDR was used.

Wait, the Methods says "enrichment analysis was based on the hypergeometric distribution, and the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple testing." So the statistical test is hypergeometric, and FDR was applied.

So, putting it all together:

1. Tool: DAVID Bioinformatics Resources
2. Version: 6.8
3. Gene set library: Not described (since they didn't specify GO vs KEGG etc.)
4. Background gene list defined? Not described (they didn't mention a custom background)
5. Statistical test: Hypergeometric distribution
6. FDR correction: Yes

Wait, but the question 3 asks what gene set library, like GO, KEGG etc. Since the authors didn't specify which library in DAVID they used (DAVID uses multiple by default), but they might have used GO. However, since the Methods don't explicitly state, the answer should be "not described".

Alternatively, maybe the Results section mention which terms they used. For example, if they talk about "Gene Ontology terms" then it's GO. Let me check Results:

In the Results: "we observed a significant overlap with phosphoserines" which is a functional association. Then when discussing tyrosine ADP-ribosylation: "For tyrosine residues, we observed a propensity for modification of ribosomal proteins." Ribosomal proteins are part of GO terms. The authors also mention "functional associations", which DAVID reports using GO. Since the Methods didn't specify, but it's implied that DAVID's default, which includes GO, KEGG, etc., but since they didn't name them, it's not described.

So the final answers are as above.
