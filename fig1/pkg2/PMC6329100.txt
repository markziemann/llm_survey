Abstract

Background

   Positively correlated with carcass weight and animal growth, the ribeye
   area (REA) and the backfat thickness (BFT) are economic important
   carcass traits, which impact directly on producer’s payment. The
   selection of these traits has not been satisfactory since they are
   expressed later in the animal’s life and multigene regulated. So,
   next-generation technologies have been applied in this area to improve
   animal’s selection and better understand the molecular mechanisms
   involved in the development of these traits. Correlation network
   analysis, performed by tools like WGCNA (Weighted Correlation Network
   Analysis), has been used to explore gene-gene interactions and
   gene-phenotype correlations. Thus, this study aimed to identify
   putative candidate genes and metabolic pathways that regulate REA and
   BFT by constructing a gene co-expression network using WGCNA and RNA
   sequencing data, to better understand genetic and molecular variations
   behind these complex traits in Nelore cattle.

Results

   The gene co-expression network analysis, using WGCNA, were built using
   RNA-sequencing data normalized by transcript per million (TPM) from 43
   Nelore steers. Forty-six gene clusters were constructed, between them,
   three were positively correlated (p-value< 0.1) to the BFT (Green
   Yellow, Ivory, and Light Yellow modules) and, one cluster was
   negatively correlated (p-value< 0.1) with REA (Salmon module). The
   enrichment analysis performed by DAVID and WebGestalt (FDR 5%)
   identified eight Gene Ontology (GO) terms and three KEGG pathways in
   the Green Yellow module, mostly associated with immune response and
   inflammatory mechanisms. The enrichment of the Salmon module
   demonstrated 19 GO terms and 21 KEGG pathways, related to muscle energy
   metabolism, lipid metabolism, muscle degradation, and oxidative stress
   diseases. The Ivory and Light yellow modules have not shown significant
   results in the enrichment analysis.

Conclusion

   With this study, we verified that inflammation and immune response
   pathways modulate the BFT trait. Energy and lipid metabolism pathways,
   highlighting fatty acid metabolism, were the central pathways
   associated with REA. Some genes, as RSAD2, EIF2AK2, ACAT1, and ACSL1
   were considered as putative candidate related to these traits.
   Altogether these results allow us to a better comprehension of the
   molecular mechanisms that lead to muscle and fat deposition in bovine.

Background

   Heavy carcass weight is critical for meat producers since it is used as
   the primary parameter for payment in the slaughterhouses [[38]1].
   Positively correlated with carcass weight and animal growth, the ribeye
   area (REA) can be used as an indicator of muscularity, prime cuts, and
   the edible mass of carcass. Inversely proportional to REA, the backfat
   thickness (BFT) is related to the percentage of fat in the carcass. BFT
   is essential to protect the carcass during cooling, avoiding problems
   such as cold shortening, drip loss and dark cutting [[39]2–[40]4].

   Despite the economic relevance for producers and to affect the final
   weight of the animals, the selection of these traits has not been
   satisfactory, since their maximum potential is expressed later in
   animal’s life [[41]1]. Therefore, a better understanding of the
   biological processes that regulate these characteristics could help to
   elucidate the mechanisms of genetic inheritance, and consequently will
   increase animal selection accuracy. In this context, next-generation
   sequencing technologies have revolutionized genome and transcriptome
   analysis of complex organisms, generating large datasets and allowing
   the identification of new genes, metabolic pathways and biological
   processes that influence the phenotype [[42]5–[43]7]. Moreover, novel
   approaches have been developed to more reliably analyze large and
   multivariate datasets by associating them with traits of interest.
   Correlation network analysis has been widely used to analyze large
   datasets as a promissory method from systems biology, able to represent
   the complexity of a cellular transcription network [[44]8–[45]10].

   The Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) is a system biology
   method that is used to explore the correlation patterns among genes in
   transcriptomic studies, providing a unique insight into the structure
   and behavior of molecular interactions [[46]8, [47]9]. The WGCNA
   describes and permits the visualization of networks derived from large
   datasets. WGCNA can be used to explore the structure of modules within
   a co-expression network, to measure the relationship between genes and
   modules (module membership), explore the relationship between modules,
   or even to rank genes or modules associated to the studied traits
   [[48]8].

   Several works utilized gene co-expression networks analysis, in
   particular, the WGCNA tool, to evaluate complex traits in different
   species such as mice [[49]11], humans [[50]12], pork [[51]13, [52]14],
   lamb [[53]10] and, cattle [[54]15–[55]18] demonstrating the correlation
   between genes and phenotype successfully.

   Kong et al. [[56]16] utilizing the WGCNA tool to understand the
   molecular differences between efficient and inefficient cattle
   concerning residual feed intake in a Hereford x Angus population,
   identified a significant module with 764 genes negatively correlated
   with the trait of interest. With the results, the authors could infer
   that efficient animals probably have an increased energy production and
   better absorption of food nutrients compared to inefficient ones.
   Sabino et al. [[57]10] used the WGCNA to do a nutrigenomics
   investigation in lambs, considering diet and sex differences in muscle
   and liver tissue, revealing a sex-dependent dietary effect on the
   transcriptome of the studied animals. In previous work from our group,
   Oliveira et al. [[58]18] employed WGCNA tool to do an integrative
   miRNA-mRNA (microRNA – messenger RNA) study associated with
   intramuscular fat deposition in Nelore cattle, revealing potential
   regulatory mechanisms of gene signaling networks involved in fat
   deposition in bovine.

   The present study aimed to gain molecular insights into economic
   important carcass traits of Nelore cattle and to identify putative
   candidate genes and metabolic pathways that regulate REA and BFT, by
   constructing a gene co-expression network using WGCNA and RNA
   sequencing data. Modules correlated with REA and BFT were identified,
   and the genes within each significant module were extracted to perform
   functional enrichment analysis, permitting us to better understand gene
   interaction, biological processes, and the metabolic pathways behind
   these complex traits.

Results

   For this study, we used RNA-sequencing normalized data by transcript
   per million (TPM) from 14,529 genes of 43 animals with contrasting
   genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV). Table [59]1 shows animal
   identification, phenotypic values, GEBVs, number of raw reads, mapped
   reads and percentage of mapped reads. The heritability values for REA
   and BFT were h^2 = 0.27 and h^2 = 0.21, respectively [[60]19].
   Additional file [61]1: Table S1 shows the contrasting GEBV groups for
   both traits, demonstrating that mean values in the low group were
   statistically different (p-value< 0.001) from the high group for REA
   and BFT. For REA, mean GEBV were − 2.94 in the low group (standard
   deviation, SD = 0.59) and, 3.14 in the high group (SD = 0.56); for BFT,
   mean GEBV were − 0.91 (SD = 0.12) and 1.24 (SD = 0.28) in the low and
   high group, respectively. The correlation analysis between the
   phenotypic (REA mean and SD values = 59.75 ± 9.50 cm^2; BFT mean and SD
   values = 7.00 ± 3.41 mm) and GEBV values both for REA and BFT showed a
   strong correlation, with r = 0.79 and r = 0.84 for REA and BFT
   respectively, justifying our selection using genomic values. On the
   other hand, the correlation analysis between the GEBV of REA x BFT
   demonstrated that these traits were independent of one another in this
   particular study, with r = − 0.06.

   The gene co-expression network analysis, performed using WGCNA program,
   resulted in the identification of 46 module eigengenes (ME)
   (Fig. [63]1). Figure [64]2 illustrates the hierarchical clustering tree
   (dendrogram) of all genes and modules colors and, in the supplementary
   material, there is a heatmap plot of the gene network
   (Additional file [65]2: Figure S1). Among the 46 identified ME, the
   Ivory, Light Yellow, Green Yellow, and Salmon modules showed a
   significant module-trait association (p-value< 0.1) with at least one
   of the studied phenotypes, demonstrating positive correlations of
   r = 0.3 with BFT (Ivory, Light Yellow and Green Yellow) and, a negative
   correlation of r = − 0.3 with REA (Salmon) (Fig. [66]1). The entire
   lists of genes in each of these modules were further analyzed using
   DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery)
   version 6.8 and, WebGestalt 2017 (WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit).

   The two KEGG pathways found were Influenza A (bta05164) and Herpes
   simplex infection (bta05168). The biological processes were defense
   response to virus (GO:0051607), innate immune response (GO:0045087),

   ISG15-protein conjugation (GO:0032020). The MF were double-stranded RNA
   binding (GO:0003725), ubiquitin-protein transferase activity
   (GO:0004842), NAD+ ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (GO:0003950) and,
   GTPase activity (GO:0003924). Most of them related to inflammation
   mechanisms and the immune system.

   The functional enrichment analysis by WebGestalt revealed three KEGG
   pathways (Table [74]2), the different pathway identified in this
   analysis was the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway (bta04621), also
   related to immune response.

   The biological processes were mostly related to energy metabolism, like
   ATP synthesis coupled proton transport (GO:0015986), tricarboxylic acid
   cycle (GO:0006099) and, fatty acid beta-oxidation (GO:0006635). From
   the eleven CC identified, seven were mitochondrial constituents, such

   chain complex I (GO:0005747), mitochondrial matrix (GO:0005759) and,
   mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase complex (GO:0005753).
   The MF were proton-transporting ATP synthase activity (GO:0046933),
   NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) activity (GO:0008137) and, electron
   carrier activity (GO:0009055), also associated to the muscle energy
   metabolism.

   Seventeen KEGG pathways were identified by DAVID (Fig. [80]4,
   Additional file [81]4: Table S3) contrasting with 21 showed in
   WebGestalt enrichment analysis (FDR 5%, Additional file [82]5: Table
   S4). All 17 pathways found by DAVID also appeared in WebGestalt
   analysis. The four different KEGG pathways identified by the second
   program (Table [83]3) were Arginine biosynthesis (bta00220),
   Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis (bta00400),
   Butanoate metabolism (bta00650) and, Lysine degradation (bta00310).
   Among the common pathways, we can highlight Fatty acid metabolism
   (bta01212), Oxidative phosphorylation (bta00190) and Citrate cycle (TCA
   cycle) (bta00020) associated to the muscle energy metabolism; and PPAR
   signaling pathway (bta03320), associated to the muscle lipid
   metabolism. And some pathways related to muscle degradation and
   oxidative stress diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease (bta05012) and
   Alzheimer’s disease (bta05010).

   At last, the Ivory and Light Yellow modules, positively correlated to
   the BFT (p-value< 0.1), presented 17 co-expressed genes and, 87
   co-expressed genes respectively (Additional files [85]6 and [86]7:

Discussion

   The commercial value of the bovine carcass is determined by the
   adequate development of muscle and adipose tissue. Therefore, an
   increase in muscle and fat masses in growing cattle is an important
   issue for farmers and beef industry. Studies involving Bos indicus
   animals have shown a lower propensity for subcutaneous fat deposition
   and Longissimus muscle area when compared to Bos taurus breeds [[87]2,
   [88]3]. Compared to other Nelore studies, our phenotypic values for REA
   (mean value = 59.75 cm^2) can be considered on the average, taking into
   account that studies in Nelore cattle show amounts varying from 40 to
   100 cm^2 [[89]1, [90]2, [91]20, [92]21]. On the other hand, the BFT
   phenotypic values (mean value = 7.00 mm) were higher than that found in
   the literature for Nelore, with mean values ranging from 1.93 to
   4.84 mm and, even higher than presented in some Bos indicus x Bos
   taurus crossbreed studies [[93]1, [94]3, [95]20–[96]22].

   The variation in ribeye area and backfat thickness in Nelore cattle is
   harmful both for producers and the beef industry since these traits
   influence carcass yield and consequently, producer’s payment [[97]3].
   It’s well known that both environment and genetics contribute to the
   phenotypic variations within a population or in the same breed. So, to
   better understand the genetic and molecular influences behind these
   economically important traits, our goal was to construct co-expressed
   gene networks and identify putative candidate genes and metabolic
   pathways that regulate these traits, using the WGCNA tool and RNA
   sequencing data.

   Forty-six gene clusters were constructed, between them, three were
   positively correlated (p-value< 0.1) to the BFT (Green Yellow, Ivory,
   and Light Yellow modules) and, one cluster was negatively correlated
   (p-value< 0.1) with REA (Salmon module). From the three positive
   correlated modules assigned to BFT, just the genes within the Green
   Yellow were significantly (FDR 5%) enriched by DAVID and WebGestalt.

   The functional enrichment analysis for the co-expressed genes from the
   Green Yellow module demonstrated that they are mainly involved in
   inflammatory mechanisms and immune response. In previous work, Oliveira
   et al. [[98]18], studying intramuscular fat deposition in this same
   Nelore cattle population also found co-expressed gene modules enriched
   for inflammatory response and immune system GO terms. Tao et al.
   [[99]23] studying the muscle and adipose transcriptomic profile of
   Indigenous x Western Chinese pig breeds associated with growth
   performance and quality carcass traits – intramuscular fat, marbling,
   and loin muscle area –, identified genes related to immune response and
   inflammation. These authors identified highly expressed and
   up-regulated genes in the muscle tissue of Chinese Indigenous breeds
   (higher BFT content) enriched for immune response, mitochondria, Herpes
   simplex infection, Parkinson’s disease, and apoptosis GO terms,
   corroborating our findings.

   The backfat, not only, is important in the industrialization process
   acting as a thermal insulator during carcass cooling but is an
   indispensable source of energy in the animal’s body, carrying
   fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids [[100]2, [101]3,
   [102]24, [103]25]. This trait also is representative of the total body
   fat in the carcass. According to Schröder and Staufenbiel [[104]26], an
   increase of just 1 mm in the BFT reflects in approximately 5 kg of the
   total body fat content in bovine.

   The increase in total body fat is defined by an adipose tissue
   expansion together with adipocyte hypertrophy [[105]27]. The fat
   deposition is a consequence of the balance between energy intake and
   expenditure. The excess of nutrients and energy can lead to an increase
   in fat accumulation – also called obesity in human and mouse studies –
   and, consequentially activate inflammatory and stress responses. So,
   this inflammatory process created by the increase in fat can disrupt
   systemic metabolic homeostasis and inhibit insulin receptor signaling,
   involving immune cells and immune response pathways. Although the
   adipose tissue is the primary source of inflammation induced by excess
   fat accumulation, it is sufficient to activate inflammatory signaling
   pathways and increase the amount of pro-inflammatory immune cells in
   other tissues, like skeletal muscle, liver, pancreas, and brain
   [[106]28–[107]32]. The molecular mechanisms behind fat deposition in
   bovine are still unclear, so studying the lipid metabolism from another
   mammalian species can clarify our knowledge about the differences in
   backfat in this cattle population.

   In our preview study, with the same Nelore population [[108]64], we
   identified biological processes related to the immune response in
   differentially expressed genes assigned to the BFT trait, similarly to
   the results found herein. Interestingly, the RSAD2 gene (Radical domain
   of S-adenosyl methionine containing 2) was down-regulated in the group
   with lower GEBV values for BFT in our previous study and, herein it was
   identified in Green Yellow module, which was positively correlated to
   BFT (p-value< 0.1).

   RSAD2 is an interferon-regulated gene associated with innate immune
   response during viral infections [[109]33, [110]34]. Additionally, this
   gene participates in lipid biosynthesis and the modulation of lipid
   droplet contents [[111]35, [112]36]. Dogan et al. [[113]36], working
   with obese-induced mouse detected higher expression of RSAD2 in animals
   with lower fat amounts, showing that this gene controls lipid droplets
   formation, but it is the RSAD2 impairment that drives fat accumulation.
   These authors further associated this gene with endoplasmic reticulum
   (ER) stress and the activation of inflammatory mechanisms in obese
   animals. According to Warfel et al. [[114]31] and Ramos-Lopez et al.
   [[115]37], one of the main contributors to the activation of
   inflammatory pathways and immune response during obesity is the
   metabolic stress of organelles, such as ER and mitochondria.

   Like RSAD2, the EIF2AK2 (Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2
   alpha kinase 2; Alias PRKR, PKR) is a key inducer of inflammation,
   responsive to interferons (IFN) and, associated with ER stress and fat
   accumulation [[116]37, [117]38]. In Green Yellow module, EIF2AK2 was
   associated with inflammatory pathways, and immune response GO terms.
   This gene encodes a protein called PKR, a serine/threonine kinase,
   activated by double-stranded RNA, cytokines, stress signals, and IFN.
   The PKR protein can be activated by lipids and, participate in major
   inflammatory signaling events, such as JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)
   activation during lipids exposition and ER stress [[118]28, [119]38].
   Nakamura et al. [[120]28] hypothesized that the increase in PKR
   activity in obese states could be caused by an excess of energy and
   nutrient supply, representing an adaptive attempt to interact with
   synthetic pathways that would further accumulate energy. In our study,
   higher expression of the EIF2AK2 gene was positively correlated with
   BFT, supporting the association of this gene with fat accumulation.

   Another gene family identified in the Green Yellow module was poly
   (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) represented by PARP9, PARP10, PARP12,
   and PARP14. PARPs activity is stimulated by excess fat, high-fat diet,
   aging, oxidative stress, DNA damage and, inflammation states. These
   enzymes are involved in lipid metabolism, mostly by controlling redox
   balance and NAD^+ homeostasis in mitochondrial metabolism [[121]39,
   [122]40]. According to Jokinen et al. [[123]39], obesity can be
   characterized by low levels of NAD^+ in the adipose tissue that can
   stimulate PARP activity. Mohamed et al. [[124]41] examined the effect
   of high-fat diet in mouse skeletal muscle cultured cells (C2C12), and
   they found that oversupplied obese animals had their levels of PARP2
   increased together with reduced mitochondrial functions and NAD^+
   levels in the cultured muscle cells.

   The NOD-like receptor signaling pathway (bta04621), the only one
   enriched by WebGestalt (Table [125]2), participates in the innate
   immune response and, can be activated by increased levels of glucose
   and free fatty acids, as well as reactive oxygen species derived from
   the inflammation state during obesity [[126]27, [127]42]. Yin et al.
   [[128]27] studying adipocytes metabolism from the adipose tissue of
   obese x non-obese women, verified an up-regulation of the NOD-like
   receptor signaling pathway in the adipocytes from the obese group. So,
   genes and metabolic pathways presented in the Green Yellow module,
   related to immune response and inflammatory processes, have an
   important paper in the lipid metabolism in mammals, demonstrating that
   there is a correlation between the increase in the expression of genes
   involved in these pathways and the BFT in cattle.

   The other significantly enriched gene module, Salmon, showed a negative
   correlation (r = − 0.3, p-value< 0.1) with the ribeye area. REA is an
   important quality carcass trait related to the amount of meat, that is
   used as an indicator of cuts yield, the percentage of muscle, animal
   growth and carcass weight [[129]1–[130]3, [131]43].

   Some of some GO terms and KEGG pathways identified here, like the fatty
   acid beta-oxidation (GO:0006635), mitochondrion (GO:0005739),
   mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase complex (GO:0005753),
   Citrate cycle (TCA cycle) (bta00020) and, Oxidative phosphorylation
   (bta00190) are part of the complex cascade of events that occur in the
   skeletal muscle for generate energy. Muscles have an essential role in
   energy metabolism, the regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism
   involves multiple pathways and different molecules committed in the
   uptake and storage of energy. The glucose and fatty acid metabolism are
   the major sources of energy in this tissue. Their energy demand is
   mainly fulfilled by phosphocreatine and ATP produced during glucose and
   fatty acid oxidation [[132]44]. In the glucose metabolism, glucose
   delivered by blood enters the myocyte, and its oxidation generates
   energy by phosphorylation. In the fatty acid metabolism, the primary
   source of energy for the muscle is the non-esterified fatty acids
   (NEFA) derived from circulation and, from lipolysis of triacylglycerols
   (TG) located mostly in the adipose tissue or, accumulated in the muscle
   (intramuscular TG). Once in the cytosol, NEFA are esterified to
   long-chain acyl CoA that is destined for mitochondrial beta-oxidation
   and, subsequently enter the TCA cycle generating ATP [[133]45,
   [134]46]. Cesar et al. [[135]47] and Oliveira et al. [[136]18],
   studying fat-related traits in this Nelore population, also identified
   energy metabolism pathways in the skeletal muscle of the animals.

   Marrades et al. [[137]48], investigating two groups of subjects (lean
   versus obese) high feed diet consuming, identified ACADM gene (Medium
   chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) in the Fatty acid β-oxidation pathway
   and, SUCLG2 (β subunit succinate-CoA ligase, GDP-forming) in the TCA
   cycle pathway, down-regulated in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of
   obese subjects. Likewise, Jeong et al. [[138]49] identified the TCA
   Cycle and Fatty Acid Oxidation genes in the Longissimus muscle of
   Korean bulls, following castration. Their enrichment analysis also
   demonstrated CPT1B (Carnitine palmitoyltransferase IB) and
   Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH) genes assigned to Fatty oxidation
   pathway; and, Succinate-CoA ligase [GDP-forming] (SUCLG), and
   Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene families in the TCA Cycle pathway.
   Also, they found some ATP (Adenosine triphosphatase), NDUF (NADH
   dehydrogenase [ubiquinone]) and COX (Cytochrome c oxidase) genes
   present in the Oxidative phosphorylation pathway, similar to our
   findings.

   Three HADH genes appeared in Salmon module enrichment analysis, HADH
   (Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase), HADHA (Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydrogenase
   Trifunctional Multienzyme Complex Subunit Alpha) and, HADHB
   (Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Trifunctional Multienzyme Complex
   Subunit Beta). Together they were identified in ten KEGG pathways,
   including two of the WebGestalt analysis (Table [139]3 and Additional
   file [140]4: Table S3). Costa et al. [[141]50], studying the fatty acid
   profile of the Longissimus muscle of a cattle population, found HADHA
   gene associated with several terms related to the fatty acid
   metabolism, like oxidation of lipid and, accumulation of specific fatty
   acids. Furthermore, HADH enzymes are crucial in the mitochondrial
   beta-oxidation, participating in the two final steps of this process
   [[142]51]. According to Zhang et al. [[143]45] and Xu et al. [[144]51],
   an up-regulation of the mitochondrial beta-oxidation process leads to a
   lower body fat content due to diminishing TG content. Maybe this could
   explain why some fatty acid metabolism terms and pathways appeared
   associated with REA, in our skeletal muscle study.

   Adjacent to the pathways and terms associated with energy metabolism,
   we also found some associated with the muscle lipid metabolism, like
   the PPAR signaling pathway (bta03320). The PPAR pathway is responsible
   for the regulation of adipocyte tissue development, adipogenic
   differentiation and, lipogenesis. The PPARs (peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptors) are nuclear receptors that take part
   in a number of biological processes, like skeletal muscle lipid
   oxidation, inflammation, mitochondrial respiration, energy homeostasis
   and, thermogenesis [[145]52–[146]54]. Several studies identified PPAR
   genes associated with fat traits in cattle [[147]18, [148]47,
   [149]53–[150]55].

   Huang et al. [[151]54] analyzing the transcriptomic profile of the
   subcutaneous adipose tissue from Wagyu and Holstein cattle confirmed
   the importance of the PPAR signaling pathway as a key regulator of
   lipid metabolism in bovine. These authors also found acetyl-CoA
   acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family
   member 1 (ACSL1) genes up-regulated in the BFT of Wagyu cattle. Here,
   the ACAT1 and ACSL1 genes were found in a gene module negatively
   associated with REA. These genes not only were verified in the PPAR
   signaling pathway; ACAT1 was identified in four GO terms and nine
   pathways (Additional file [152]4: Table S3), two of them only by
   WebGestalt (Table [153]3) – Butanoate metabolism (bta00650) and Lysine
   degradation (bta00310). The ACSL1 was found in the mitochondrion
   (GO:0005739) and, four KEGG pathways (Additional file [154]4: Table
   S3).

   ACAT1 is a fatty acid deposition gene that catalyzes the conversion of
   cholesterol to cholesteryl esters [[155]56–[156]58]. Yue et al.
   [[157]58] selected the ACAT1 as a candidate gene to study adipogenesis
   in bovine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Like ACAT1, ACSL1 is
   crucial for the lipid metabolism, contributing to fatty acid
   biosynthesis, transport, storage and degradation; and, taking part in
   the mitochondrial beta-oxidation process [[158]54, [159]59]. Zhao et
   al. [[160]60] evaluating different tissues of Qinchuan cattle verified
   that ACSL1 mRNA was highly expressed in the skeletal muscle
   (Longissimus thoracis) and subcutaneous fat, affirming that this gene
   may contribute to the determination of fatty acid composition in bovine
   skeletal muscle. Recently, Poleti et al. [[161]61] found ACSL1 protein
   as differentially abundant when studying the intramuscular fat
   deposition in the LD muscle of this Nelore population.

   Another noteworthy gene verified in the PPAR pathway is SLC27A6 (Solute
   Carrier Family 27 Member 6), part of the solute carrier superfamily
   (SLC). The solute carrier family 27A (SLC27A) is a group of molecules
   ubiquitously expressed, involved in the lipid metabolism by
   transporting fatty acid proteins [[162]62, [163]63]. According to Melo
   et al. [[164]63], despite the SLC27A family is essential for body lipid
   distribution, the SLC27A1 was found more expressed in the skeletal
   muscle than adipose tissue, suggesting that this gene has a critical
   role in the absorption and storage of fatty acids by the muscle.

   Beside the SLC27A1, we also identified other SLC members in the Salmon
   module – SLC25A3, SLC25A4, SLC25A11, SLC25A12 and, SLC26A9 – associated
   to three cellular components and two oxidative stress diseases pathways
   (Additional file [165]4: Table S3). In previous work with this Nelore
   population, we have already found SLC genes more expressed in the group
   with the lowest GEBV for REA [[166]64]. Junior et al. [[167]1],
   considered SLC38A1 and 2 as candidate genes for muscle growth
   associated with REA, in a GWAS study with Nelore cattle. In another
   way, Costa et al. [[168]50] identified the SLC37A4 involved in relevant
   lipid metabolism biological functions, such as the concentration of
   lipid, metabolism of triacylglycerol and homeostasis of cholesterol,
   when studying the bovine Longissimus muscle. Thus, the enrichment
   analysis of the Salmon module demonstrates the complex regulation of
   skeletal muscle energy and lipid metabolism, helping us to understand
   molecular insights occurring in the bovine LD muscle that can influence
   REA.

Conclusions

   With the construction of co-expressed gene modules, we verified that
   inflammation and immune response pathways and biological processes
   could modulate the BFT in Nelore cattle. RSAD2, EIF2AK2, and PARP genes
   could be considered as putative candidate genes for BFT trait. For REA,
   we found that energy and lipid metabolism, mainly the fatty acid
   metabolism, were the major pathways regulating this trait in this
   cattle population. We highlight ACAT1 and ACSL1 as putative candidate
   genes, associated with the energy and lipid metabolism in the skeletal
   muscle. These results allow us a better comprehension of the molecular
   mechanisms that are behind these economically important traits, that
   lead to muscle and fat deposition in bovine.

Methods

Animals and phenotypes

   A total of 385 Nelore steers descending 34 unrelated bulls,
   representing the main pedigree lineages of Brazilian Nelore cattle,
   raised between 2009 to 2011, were used in this study. All animals were
   raised in the same nutritional and handling conditions and, finished in
   feedlot. More details were provided in [[169]19].

   The animals were slaughtered at an average age of 25 months in a
   commercial abattoir located in Bariri (São Paulo, Brazil) under Federal
   Inspection Service (SIF) supervision and, Brazilian Ministry of
   Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply (MAPA) regularization. As
   mentioned in our previous research [[170]64], 5 g of the Longissimus
   dorsi (LD) muscle (12th-13th ribs) was collected from the right side of
   the carcasses at the time of slaughter and stored in liquid nitrogen
   until RNA-Sequencing analyses. A sample of the LD muscle (10th-13th
   ribs) was excised at 24 h after slaughter from the left side of the
   carcasses and transported to the Embrapa Pecuária Sudeste Laboratory
   (São Carlos, São Paulo, Brazil) to measure REA and BFT. The REA was
   dimensioned with a grid of points (values presented in cm^2) and, the
   BFT was measured with a graduated ruler (values shown in mm). All the
   experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
   and Use Committee Guidelines from Embrapa (approval code CEUA 01/2013).

   To the co-expression network analysis, we selected 48 animals with
   contrasting genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV, Additional file
   [171]1: Table S1) from the total population of 385 animals, where 12
   represents the higher values and 12 the lowest values of REA (mean and
   SD values = 3.14 ± 0.56 and − 2.94 ± 0.59) and BFT (mean and SD
   values = 1.24 ± 0.28 and − 0.91 ± 0.12), respectively. After that, the
   lists of the animals were combined, and the repeated ones were removed,
   totaling 43 animals. The GEBV were calculated by GenSel program
   [[172]65], based in the SNP marker information, obtained by the
   BovineHD 770 k BeadChip (Infinium BeadChip, Illumina, CA, USA), as
   described in [[173]66]. The a priori genetic and residual variance
   values were obtained from the Bayes C analysis where the genetic and a
   priori residual variance was equal to 1 [[174]67]. A new Bayes C
   analysis was performed with the previous values for genetic and
   residual variances to estimate the GEBV values for each animal.
   Correlation analysis between the phenotypic values of REA and BFT x the
   GEBV for these traits and, the GEBV for REA x GEBV for BFT were
   performed in the R program.

RNA-sequencing

     * RNA extraction: Total RNA was extracted from approximately 100 mg
       of muscle tissue (n = 43) using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies,
       Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
       The RNA integrity was verified using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent,
       Santa Clara, CA, USA). All the samples presented an RNA Integrity
       Number (RIN) greater than 7.
     * Library preparation: A total of 2 μg of total RNA of each sample
       was used for library preparation following the TruSeq RNA Sample
       Preparation kit v2 guide (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) protocol.
       Libraries were quantified utilizing quantitative PCR with the KAPA
       Library Quantification kit (KAPA Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA),
       and libraries mean size was estimated by the Bioanalyzer 2100.
     * Sequencing, quality control and alignment: Samples were diluted for
       the same concentration and grouped in pools. The sequencing
       flowcell lanes were clustered with the TruSeq PE Cluster kit
       v3-cBot-HS (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and then, sequenced using
       HiSeq2500 ultra-high-throughput sequencing system (Illumina, San
       Diego, CA, USA) with the TruSeq SBS kit v3-HS. A more detailed
       description can be found in [[175]47]. SeqClean software
       ([176]https://sourceforge.net/projects/seqclean/files/) was
       employed to remove the adapters sequences used in the library
       preparation step, and low-complexity reads. For the quality
       control, FastQC version 0.10.1 software
       ([177]http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
       was applied. TopHat version 2.1.0 software [[178]68] was used to
       map the read alignment against the reference genome Bos taurus
       UMD3.1 ([179]http://www.ensembl.org/Bos_taurus/Info/Index/).
       Lastly, read counts for all annotated genes were calculated
       adopting HTSeq software version 0.6.1
       ([180]https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.10.0/) [[181]69].
       Only read sequences that uniquely align to know chromosomes were
       used in this study.

Co-expression network analysis

   To perform the co-expression network analysis, we used the WGCNA
   (Weighted Correlation Network Analysis) package from R [[182]8], with
   RNA-Sequencing data (n = 43) with their counts normalized by transcript
   per million (TPM). After the data input, a cleaning and preprocessing
   step were done to remove outlier samples and genes with excessive
   numbers of missing entries. So, from a list of 15,631 genes inputted,
   14,529 ones were used to construct gene networks with the
   “blockwiseModules” function.

   First, a matrix of similarity was constructed by calculating Pearson
   correlations, to measure the similarity between the gene expression
   profiles of all the samples. Then, the similarity matrix was
   transformed into an adjacency matrix (A) raised to a β exponent (soft
   threshold) based on the free-scale topology criterion. In this study,
   the β parameter was equal to 6, and the free-scale topology was
   R^2 = 0.80. The topological overlap matrix (TOM) was used to define
   modules based on dissimilarity (1-TOM). The minimum and maximum module
   size (genes per module) were five and 12,000, respectively. Modules
   were merged based on the dissimilarity between their eigengenes, which
   is the first principal component of each module and, represents the
   gene expression profile within the module [[183]8]. For modules
   grouping, was used a threshold of 0.25 corresponding to a correlation
   of 0.75. Finally, for each gene module was assigned a color, genes not
   assembled to any modules were grouped in the Grey module.

   Module-trait associations were estimated using the correlation between
   the module eigengene (ME) and the GEBV values of REA and BFT, allowing
   the identification of modules highly correlated with the interest
   traits. Genes of modules with significant module-trait associations
   (p-value< 0.1), for at least one trait, were assigned for functional
   enrichment analysis.

Functional enrichment analysis

   An Overrepresentation Enrichment Analysis (ORA) was performed by DAVID
   (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery)
   version 6.8 [[184]70]; and, WebGestalt 2017 (WEB-based GEne SeT
   AnaLysis Toolkit) [[185]71]. DAVID software revealed all Gene Ontology
   (GO) terms (BP, CC, and MF) and KEGG pathways of the co-expressed genes
   with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 5%. WebGestalt was used to find
   additional relevant KEGG pathways (FDR 5%) that may not appear in DAVID
   analysis, to better understand the biological mechanisms involved in
   each trait studied. The Bos taurus genome was used as background for
   both analyses.
