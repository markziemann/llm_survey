Here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis details as described in the provided text, formatted for a table:

| **Question** | **Answer** |
|---|---|
| 1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | R package |
| 2. Was a tool version number provided? | Not described |
| 3. What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)? | GO and KEGG |
| 4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis? | Yes, “All the proteins” were used as the background. |
| 5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis? | Fisher’s exact test |
| 6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis? | Yes, Q-value was calculated to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR). The significance threshold was defined as FDR < 0.05. |
