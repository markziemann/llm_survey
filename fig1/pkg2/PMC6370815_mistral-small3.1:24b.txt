2. **Was a tool version number provided?**
   - Yes, version 1.16.4.

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**
   - KEGG gene sets from MSigDB were queried.

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - Not described.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**
   - Fisherâ€™s exact test
