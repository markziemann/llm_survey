| 1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery)                                             |
| 2. Was a tool version number provided?       | Not described                                                                                                    |
| 3. What gene set library was queried?        | GO (Gene Ontology)                                                                                              |
| 4. Was a background gene list defined?       | Yes, "Individual gene names from David functional clustering analysis" was used as the background.                        |
| 5. What statistical test was used?            | Not described                                                                                                    |
| 6. Was false discovery rate correction used? | Yes, false discovery rate correction was used to control the number of false positives.                              |
