|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?                   | Not explicitly described    |
| 2. Was a tool version number provided?                                   | No                          |
| 3. What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)? | GO and KEGG                 |
| 4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?   | Not described               |
| 5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?               | Not explicitly described    |
| 6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis? | Not explicitly described    |

### Explanation:

1. **Tool Used**: The article mentions using GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) for pathway enrichment but does not specify a particular software tool or package used.
   
2. **Tool Version Number**: No version number is provided in the text.

3. **Gene Set Library Queried**: The article specifies that GO and KEGG were queried, indicating these gene set libraries were used.

4. **Background Gene List Defined**: There is no mention of how a background gene list was defined for pathway enrichment analysis.

5. **Statistical Test Used**: The specific statistical test used for the enrichment analysis is not detailed in the article.

6. **False Discovery Rate Correction**: The use of false discovery rate correction to control false positives is not explicitly mentioned in the text.
