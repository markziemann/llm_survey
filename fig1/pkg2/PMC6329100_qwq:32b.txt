Okay, I need to figure out the answers to these six questions about the pathway enrichment analysis in the provided scientific article. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the user wants to know which tool was used. Looking at the Methods section under "Functional enrichment analysis," it says they used DAVID version 6.8 and WebGestalt 2017. So the tools are DAVID and WebGestalt.

Next, the version numbers: DAVID's version is given as 6.8, and WebGestalt is specified as 2017. So both versions are provided.

For the gene set library, DAVID typically uses GO terms and KEGG pathways. The text mentions GO terms (BP, CC, MF) and KEGG pathways. WebGestalt was also used for KEGG pathways. So the libraries are GO and KEGG.

Background gene list: The methods state "The Bos taurus genome was used as background for both analyses." So yes, the background is the entire Bos taurus genome.

Statistical test: DAVID uses a modified Fisher's exact test for ORA, but the exact test isn't named explicitly here. The article mentions FDR, so maybe Fisher's exact. WebGestalt likely uses similar. The question is about the test used; the text doesn't specify beyond ORA, which typically uses Fisher's.

FDR correction: The article says DAVID used FDR of 5%, and WebGestalt also used FDR 5%. So yes, FDR correction was applied.

Let me check again. The Methods for functional analysis says DAVID v6.8 and WebGestalt 2017. The gene sets are GO and KEGG. Background is Bos taurus genome. The statistical test isn't explicitly named, but ORA usually uses Fisher's. FDR was applied (FDR<5%).

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**  
   DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) version 6.8 and WebGestalt 2017.

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**  
   Yes. DAVID version 6.8 and WebGestalt 2017 were specified.

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome, or other)?**  
   GO terms (Biological Process, Cellular Component, Molecular Function) and KEGG pathways were used.

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**  
   Yes. The Bos taurus genome was used as the background for both DAVID and WebGestalt analyses.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**  
   Overrepresentation Enrichment Analysis (ORA) was performed. While the exact statistical test (e.g., Fisher's exact test) was not explicitly named, ORA typically uses Fisher's exact test or a similar method. The text specifies a False Discovery Rate (FDR) threshold of 5%.

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**  
   Yes. Both DAVID and WebGestalt analyses applied FDR correction (FDR < 5%).
