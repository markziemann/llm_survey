Alright, I need to help the user by examining how pathway enrichment analysis was conducted in the provided scientific article. The focus should be on the Methods section, but I might have to look at other parts too if necessary.

First, I'll scan through the Abstract and see if there's any mention of tools or methods related to pathway enrichment. The Abstract mentions gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Metacore®. That suggests that Metacore is likely the tool used for the analysis. 

Next, looking into the Methods section isn't possible since it's not included here, but the Additional Files provide clues. Specifically, Additional File 8 and Additional File 9 refer to gene ontology cell process enrichment using Metacore®. So, the tool is definitely Metacore.

Now, checking if there's a version number mentioned. The text doesn't specify any version for Metacore, so that's not described.

For the gene set library, since they mention GO and use Metacore, it's safe to say they used Gene Ontology (GO) terms from Metacore.

Regarding the background gene list, the article doesn’t provide details on whether a specific background was defined. It might have used the default settings in Metacore, but without explicit info, I can't confirm.

Statistical test and FDR correction: The text refers to p-values and false discovery rates (FDR) in the tables, indicating that FDR was used to control false positives. As for the exact statistical test, it's not specified beyond mentioning p-values, so that part is unclear.

Putting it all together, I can answer each question based on the information provided.

Here is a summary of how pathway enrichment analysis was conducted in the article:

1. **Tool Used**: Metacore®  
2. **Version Number Provided**: Not described  
3. **Gene Set Library Queried**: Gene Ontology (GO) terms  
4. **Background Gene List Defined**: Not described  
5. **Statistical Test Used**: Not explicitly described  
6. **False Discovery Rate Correction**: Yes, False Discovery Rate (FDR) was used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis.

This information was collated from various sections of the article and supplementary materials provided.
