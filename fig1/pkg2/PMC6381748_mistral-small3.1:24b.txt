To identify glucose-dependent regulated proteins, the same criteria described above was used to
   identify regulated proteins. (2.5 and 16.7 mM
   glucose), and includes information on the fold change, p-value, protein
   accession number, protein name, gene name and FDR. (XLSX 48 kb)
   stimulation. The table shows p-site quantification of five experimental replicates performed on both experimental
   conditions (2.5 and 16.7 mM glucose), including delta differences and p-value, fold change,
   protein accession number, protein name, gene name and FDR. (XLS 4 kb)

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - The authors used MetacoreÂ® for pathway enrichment analysis.

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**
   - Not described.

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome, etc.)?**
   - The authors used the gene ontology (GO) library.

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - Not described.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**
   - Not described.

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - Yes, the authors used false discovery rate (FDR) in tables S4-S6.
