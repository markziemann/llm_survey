Based on your request and the information provided, here's an examination of how pathway enrichment analysis might have been conducted, focusing primarily on what can be inferred from typical practices given that specific details may not always be explicitly stated:

1. **Tool Used for Pathway Enrichment Analysis**: 
   - The article does not specify which tool was used for the pathway enrichment analysis.

2. **Tool Version Number Provided**:
   - No version number of the tool is provided in the text.

3. **Gene Set Library Queried**:
   - The gene set library queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome) is not described in the article.

4. **Background Gene List Defined for Pathway Enrichment Analysis**:
   - It is not mentioned whether a background gene list was defined for pathway enrichment analysis.

5. **Statistical Test Used for Enrichment Analysis**:
   - The specific statistical test used for enrichment analysis is not described in the article.

6. **False Discovery Rate Correction Used**:
   - There is no mention of false discovery rate correction being applied to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis.

For a comprehensive understanding, it would be beneficial to refer directly to the supplementary materials or methods section if available, as they might contain additional details not covered in the main text.
