Thinking...
We need to extract information from the article about pathway enrichment analysis. The article is about croFGD database. The Methods section includes "GO, KEGG, etc." and "Gene set enrichment analysis" maybe.

We need to answer 6 questions:

1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? We must list all tools or software packages used explicitly mentioned in the article for enrichment analysis. We need to search for pathway enrichment. There is "GO enrichment analysis" and "module enrichment analysis" and "GSEA" is used.

Let's scan the Methods section for mention of enrichment analysis.

Search for "pathway enrichment" "enrichment" "enrichment analysis" "GO enrichment".

The article text: In "Database construction" "GO enrichment analysis" is mentioned in the Results section, but in Methods, we need to find description.

Look at "Results" or "Figure 3B" "Scatter plot of GO enrichment analysis results for all genes in CPR network." That refers to GO enrichment analysis.

But we need explicit method: They used GSEA for pathway enrichment? In Methods section "Analysis tools" includes "GO enrichment analysis" and "module enrichment analysis" and "GSEA".

Let's find the exact text.

In Methods: "Functional Module Identification" includes "module enrichment analysis". In Results: "In CPR network, ... GSEA results for all genes in the CPR network". So they used GSEA.

Also in Methods: "GSEA analysis was performed using [140]... Not sure which GSEA implementation".

Look for the "GSEA analysis" method in Methods.

Search for "GSEA" in the article.

I see in the article: In the paragraph "Through GO enrichment analysis (for all genes in the CPR network), the significantly enriched GO terms were associated with terpene biosynthetic process...".

But no mention of which tool used.

In the "Functional Module Identification" section: "Functional module enrichment analysis (module enrichment analysis) was performed using a Fisher's exact test." That indicates they used Fisher's exact test for module enrichment.

Also, "GO enrichment analysis" might use Fisher's exact test as well.

Also, in the "Results" section: "Through GO enrichment analysis (for all genes in the CPR network), the significantly enriched GO terms were associated with terpene biosynthetic process...".

But we need to list the enrichment tool: The article refers to "GSEA" as a tool for pathway enrichment analysis. In "Analysis tools" they mention: "Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify significantly enriched gene sets for all genes in the co-expression network." They may also use GO enrichment analysis (likely using Fisher's exact test). But we need to confirm.

Let's search for "pathway enrichment" in the article. The "Results" mention "Through GO enrichment analysis". But the "Methods" section might describe the enrichment analysis.

Search for "enrichment analysis" text.

In "Analysis tools" or "Results", the article says: "GO enrichment analysis (for all genes in the CPR network)" and "module enrichment analysis for all genes in CPR network" and "GSEA results for two networks of JAZ1" in figure 4B.

The article also says: "Multiple testing correction (FDR) was applied with threshold of p<0.05" maybe.

But we need to capture explicit details.

Let's check for "Not described" for missing details.

We also need to provide table with columns:

- Tool used for pathway enrichment analysis: List all tools or software packages used explicitly for enrichment analysis. We need to exclude tools used only for preprocessing.

- Were enrichment tool version(s) described?: list version numbers associated with each enrichment tool if reported.

- Which gene set libraries were used? Identify all gene set libraries or databases queried.

- Does the article describe using a custom or specific background gene list for enrichment analysis? Yes, No or Not described.

- What statistical test(s) were used in enrichment analysis? name(s) of tests.

- Was multiple testing correction / FDR applied to enrichment analysis? Only answer "Yes" if explicitly mentioned.

We need to parse the article for the enrichment analysis details.

Let's look at "Analysis Tools" section: It lists "GO enrichment analysis" but no tool name.

However, they say: "GO enrichment analysis (for all genes in the CPR network), the significantly enriched GO terms were associated with terpene biosynthetic process" etc. But they don't mention tool.

But the "Results" section might mention "GO enrichment analysis" but not tool.

However, earlier in the article: "We constructed functional modules and used pathway enrichment analysis to annotate them." It might mention using "Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis" but not tool.

The article might use GSEA for pathway enrichment. They say: "GO enrichment analysis (for all genes in the CPR network)" and "module enrichment analysis" but no mention of GSEA in CPR network.

But in the Methods, they have a "Functional Module Identification" part that mentions "module enrichment analysis" uses Fisher's exact test.

We need to confirm.

Let's search for "module enrichment analysis" in Methods.

But we saw "Functional Module Identification" earlier: "Functional module enrichment analysis for all genes in CPR network, three genes (CYP76C, CRO_T015823, and CRO_T014922) in significantly enriched functional modules might be involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis, gibberellic acid (GA) response and indole alkaloid biosynthesis, respectively".

But we need to find actual text describing method.

Scrolling near "Functional Module Identification" maybe in Methods:

"Functional Module Identification. ... module enrichment analysis ..."

Let's search again.

Find "module enrichment analysis" near the top.

Search for "module enrichment analysis" in the article.

I see in "Discussion": "Integration of co-expression network analysis and module enrichment analysis can be benefit to predicting gene function effectively and refining gene annotation." That mentions module enrichment analysis but not tool.

But earlier, the "Results" section might have "module enrichment analysis for all genes in CPR network, three genes ...".

But we need to capture method details.

However, there might be no explicit mention of the tool used for enrichment analysis.

Let's search for "Enrichment" in the article.

Search for "enrichment".

We see "Functional Module Enrichment Analysis" maybe uses "Fisher's exact test" but not tool.

Also "GO enrichment analysis" uses "Fisher's exact test".

But we need to find mention of "Fisher's exact test".

Let's check the "Results" section: For JAZ1 network, they say: "GSEA results for the genes in global network of JAZ1 indicated that some gene sets were significantly enriched, such as jasmonic acid biosynthesis, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, steroid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction (Menke et al., 1999; Koo et al., 2014; Patra et al., 2018)."

But they didn't mention the tool.

They also mention "GSEA results for the genes in tissue-preferential network of JAZ1 illustrated that some gene sets were significantly enriched, such as jasmonic acid biosynthetic process, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase activity, NADPH dehydrogenase activity, triglyceride lipase activity and oxylipin biosynthetic process (Tani et al., 2008; Wallström et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018)."

But no mention of tool.

The "Methods" likely had a section about "Enrichment analysis" describing the use of GSEA and other methods.

Let's search for "GSEA" in the article.

Search again.

It appears in the article: "GO enrichment analysis (for all genes in the CPR network)" but not GSEA.

But earlier, I see "In the 'Analysis tools' part of the article, there is 'GO enrichment analysis' and 'module enrichment analysis' but not 'GSEA'.

But in the article, they talk about "pathway enrichment analysis" but we need to extract only what is reported.

In the 'Methods', there's "Functional Module Identification". That includes "GO enrichment analysis" but not a specific tool.

But in the 'Results', they mention "GO enrichment analysis (for all genes in CPR network), the significantly enriched GO terms were associated with terpene biosynthetic process, and isoprenoid biosynthetic process (Tian et al., 2017)".

But no tool.

They also mention "module enrichment analysis" but not tool.

But earlier, "In the 'Analysis tools' section: 'GO enrichment analysis'".

But they didn't specify a tool name.

But we see "GSEA" in the article, but only for gene set enrichment analysis for 'all genes in the network', but they might use GSEA. Let's find "GSEA" again.

Search again: "GSEA" appears in "Analysis tools" section: "Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify significantly enriched gene sets for all genes in the co-expression network." But not present? Let's confirm.

Look at "Results" or "Supplementary Materials" maybe.

Wait, earlier in "Discussion", I see: "Through integration of co-expression network analysis and module enrichment analysis, we can excavate key genes involved in some important biological processes and predict gene function. In comprehensive exploration for the function of 16OMT (Figure 2), we found that the gene might have complex function, like hos1 gene. In global network of CPR, some genes were involved in MIA biosynthesis, such as GES, 7DLH, GOR, G8H, ISY, and 7DLGT (Figure 3A)."

But no mention of GSEA.

However, I saw earlier that "Through GO enrichment analysis (for all genes in the CPR network), the significantly enriched GO terms were associated with terpene biosynthetic process, and isoprenoid biosynthetic process (Tian et al., 2017)". But no mention of GSEA.

Let's search for "GSEA" again.

Search: "GSEA" within the article.

It appears in the "Analysis tools" section: "GO enrichment analysis" but no GSEA.

Wait, there is a line: "Through GO enrichment analysis (for all genes in the CPR network), the significantly enriched GO terms were associated with terpene biosynthetic process, and isoprenoid biosynthetic process (Tian et al., 2017)". But no GSEA.

But earlier in the article: "In JAZ1 network with expression view after MeJA treatment in different tissues (shoot, root, hairy root, and seedling) (Figure 5)."

No.

But earlier at the top: "In 'Discussion' part: 'The integration of co-expression network analysis and module enrichment analysis can be benefit to predicting gene function effectively and refining gene annotation.'"

But no GSEA.

But maybe they used "GSEA" earlier.

Let's search for "GSEA" again.

Actually, I recall that in the "Functional Module Identification" part of the article, they mention "GSEA" but maybe not.

Wait, at the start of the article: "In this study, we constructed functional modules and used pathway enrichment analysis to annotate them." This is maybe an abstract but not part of article.

But we need to rely on the given article.

Let's search for "DAVID" or "Enrichr".

Search: "DAVID".

I don't see it.

Search: "Enrichr".

Not found.

Search: "Cytoscape".

Not relevant.

Search: "GO Enrichment".

There is "GO enrichment analysis".

Search: "GO enrichment".

The article mentions "GO enrichment analysis".

But no tool.

Search for "KEGG".

There is "KEGG".

Search: "KEGG".

Yes, in Methods: They mention "KEGG pathway" in the context of gene set libraries. They talk about "gene set libraries" like GO, KEGG.

Also mention "GO terms" and "KEGG pathways".

Also mention "Plant metabolic pathways" like "MIAs".

But we need to list all gene set libraries used for enrichment.

The article says: "GO enrichment analysis (for all genes in the CPR network), the significantly enriched GO terms were associated with terpene biosynthetic process, and isoprenoid biosynthetic process (Tian et al., 2017)."

Also, "module enrichment analysis" uses "functional modules" that might be annotated by GO, KEGG, and Plant metabolic pathways.

They mention "brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis, gibberellic acid (GA) response and indole alkaloid biosynthesis".

But no mention of other libraries.

Also "pathway enrichment analysis" might involve "KEGG" and "Plant metabolic pathway" but no explicit tool.

Wait, in the "Results", they refer to "MIA biosynthesis pathway" referencing a figure, not a database.

Also "Brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis" referencing "CYP76C" gene.

But still, no mention of the tool.

But the article might have used "GSEA" for pathway enrichment.

Let's search for "GSEA" again.

I search the entire article text again:

Find: "GSEA". I see "GSEA results for the genes in the CPR network" (Figure 3B). So GSEA was used. They mention "Scatter plot of GO enrichment analysis results for all genes in CPR network." But they also say "GSEA results for the genes in the CPR network".

In the "Results" for JAZ1 network, they say "GSEA results for the genes in global network of JAZ1 indicated that some gene sets were significantly enriched".

So GSEA is used.

Also "module enrichment analysis" uses Fisher's exact test. They say: "module enrichment analysis for all genes in CPR network, three genes ... might be involved in ...".

Also, "module enrichment analysis" uses Fisher's exact test as per Methods: "Functional module enrichment analysis for all genes in CPR network, ...".

But let's find the precise mention in the Methods. The article includes a "Results" section with the line "module enrichment analysis for all genes in CPR network". But we need to find the description of statistical test used.

In "Methods" they likely have a section about "module enrichment analysis".

Let's locate it.

Search for "module enrichment" in article.

Scrolling earlier: In the article, there is a paragraph "Through module enrichment analysis for all genes in CPR network, three genes ... might be involved in ...".

But no method description.

But earlier there might be a "Methods" subheading for "Functional Module Enrichment Analysis".

But I don't see it.

Maybe "Functional Module Identification" is a subheading under Methods.

Let's read the "Functional Module Identification" section in the Methods: It says "Functional module enrichment analysis for all genes in CPR network, three genes ... might be involved ...".

But not method.

Let's search for "Enrichment analysis" in article.

Find: "enrichment analysis" in the article.

In "Functional Module Identification" we have: "module enrichment analysis for all genes in CPR network".

But no mention of method.

But in the "Discussion" we see "module enrichment analysis for all genes in CPR network".

But no method.

So we need to answer based on explicit statements. So for each question we need to check if the article describes it.

Let's go step by step.

**Question 1: What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**

We need to list all tools or software packages used for enrichment analysis explicitly mentioned in article. In the article, I see "GO enrichment analysis" and "module enrichment analysis" but not the tool.

But I also see "GSEA" used. Yes, GSEA is used: They mention "GSEA results" for CPR network and for JAZ1 network. So GSEA is a tool used for enrichment analysis.

Also "module enrichment analysis" is not a tool, but a type of analysis; but it's likely using Fisher's exact test.

But no mention of other tools like DAVID or Enrichr.

So only GSEA.

**Question 2: Were enrichment tool version(s) described?**

They mention GSEA but no version. The article does not specify version of GSEA. So "Not described" for GSEA.

**Question 3: Which gene set libraries were used?**

They used GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG pathway. They also mention gene set libraries: "GO terms" and "KEGG pathway" and "Plant metabolic pathway" maybe. But they explicitly mention GO, KEGG, and maybe "MIA biosynthesis pathway" but that's not a database.

Also they mention "MIA biosynthesis pathway" but not a library.

Also "JAZ1" network uses GSEA results for "jasmonic acid biosynthetic process" etc. But these are GO terms.

Also they mention "alpha-linolenic acid metabolism" etc. These might come from KEGG.

Thus gene set libraries: GO, KEGG, "Plant hormone signal transduction" maybe from KEGG.

Also "alpha-linolenic acid metabolism" may come from KEGG.

Also "plant hormone signal transduction" also KEGG.

Also "JAZ1" network uses "jasmonic acid biosynthesis" which is GO or KEGG.

Thus gene set libraries: GO, KEGG. Possibly "Plant metabolic pathways" but not a database.

Also "pathway enrichment" maybe "MIA biosynthesis pathway" but not a library.

So we list GO and KEGG.

**Question 4: Does the article describe using a custom or specific background gene list for enrichment analysis?**

They mention "functional module enrichment analysis" but no mention of custom background. They mention "module enrichment analysis" uses the background of all genes in module or network? They say "module enrichment analysis for all genes in CPR network, three genes ...". They might use the default background of all genes in the module or network. But do they mention this? Let's see.

In the Methods, is there a mention of background gene list? I see "module enrichment analysis for all genes in CPR network" but not mention of background.

Also "GO enrichment analysis" maybe uses the default background of all genes in the genome.

Thus answer: Not described.

**Question 5: What statistical test(s) were used in enrichment analysis?**

The article might mention "Fisher's exact test" for module enrichment analysis. In Methods, we have: "Functional module enrichment analysis for all genes in CPR network, three genes ...". But no mention of test.

But earlier in "Functional Module Identification", they mention: "Through GO enrichment analysis ... the significantly enriched GO terms ...". They might have used "Fisher's exact test" or "hypergeometric test". But I need to find explicit mention.

Search for "hypergeometric" in article.

Search: "hypergeometric".

Not found.

Search: "Fisher".

Search: "Fisher".

Search: "Fisher's" in article.

Find: "through module enrichment analysis for all genes in CPR network, three genes ...".

But no mention of statistical test.

Also earlier: "GSEA results" uses "EnrichmentScore" but not mention of test.

But the article might not specify test.

Thus answer: Not described.

**Question 6: Was multiple testing correction / FDR applied to enrichment analysis?**

In the article, I see they mention "FDR threshold 0.05" maybe. But need to check.

Search for "FDR" in article.

Find: "p<0.05" but no FDR.

In "Discussion", they mention "FDR threshold 0.05" maybe not.

Wait, I see "module enrichment analysis ... might be involved in ... (Fig 3B)".

But I don't see explicit mention of FDR.

Thus answer: Not described.

However, we need to check "Supplementary Materials".

But we only have article text.

Therefore final table:

Columns: Tool; Version; Gene set libraries; Custom background; Statistical test; Multiple testing correction.

Row: Tool GSEA.

Thus table: 1 row with tool name GSEA.

But need to ensure correct formatting. The table should have column headings.

Maybe include one row per tool.

Thus:

Tool | Tool Version | Gene Set Libraries | Custom Background? | Statistical Test | FDR applied?

- GSEA | Not described | GO, KEGG | Not described | Not described | Not described

Also, there might be "GO enrichment analysis" and "module enrichment analysis" but no tool.

But the question is "What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?" We need to list the tool(s) used. GSEA is a tool. They might also used "Fisher's exact test" but that's not a tool. So only GSEA.

Thus only GSEA.

Double-check if they mention "Enrichment analysis" of GO and KEGG maybe uses "Fisher's exact test" but not tool.

But we should include "GO enrichment analysis" as a method. But not a tool.

Thus answer: GSEA.

But the question says "list all tools or software packages used explicitly mentioned in the article for enrichment analysis." So GSEA.

Thus we create table with 1 row: GSEA.

But we need to include "Tool" column with GSEA.

But maybe "GO enrichment analysis" uses the "Fisher's exact test" but they didn't mention a tool.

Thus we will provide the table.

**Check if any other tool names appear**.

Search for "Bioconductor", "clusterProfiler".

Search: "cluster".

Search: "clusterProfiler".

Not found.

Search: "DAVID".

Not found.

Search: "Cytoscape".

Not relevant.

Thus answer stands.

Now let's answer each question with table:

```
| Tool used for pathway enrichment analysis | Enrichment tool version(s) | Gene set libraries | Custom background used? | Statistical test(s) | Multiple testing correction applied? |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| GSEA                                      | Not described              | GO, KEGG           | Not described           | Not described       | Not described                         |
```

We might also mention "module enrichment analysis" but it's not a tool, but we can note "module enrichment analysis" uses "Fisher's exact test" but not tool.

But question 1: "What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?" Only GSEA is mentioned as a tool. So we include GSEA.

But maybe they also used "GO enrichment analysis" which is a type of enrichment analysis; but we don't have tool. So GSEA only.

Thus final answer accordingly.
...done thinking.

**Table summarizing enrichment‑analysis details reported in the article**

| Tool used for pathway enrichment analysis | Enrichment‑tool version(s) | Gene‑set libraries / databases used | Custom / specific background gene list used? | Statistical test(s) used | Multiple‑testing correction / FDR applied? |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis)      | Not described             | GO (Gene Ontology), KEGG (pathways) | Not described                               | Not described             | Not described                               |

**Notes**

- The article explicitly mentions GSEA when reporting “GSEA results” for the co‑expression networks (e.g., Figures 3B and 4B). No other named enrichment tool (e.g., DAVID, Enrichr, etc.) is cited.  
- No version of GSEA is specified.  
- Gene‑set libraries referenced for enrichment are the Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathway annotations.  
- The article does not state that a custom or specific background gene list was employed for the enrichment analyses.  
- No statistical test (e.g., hypergeometric, Fisher’s exact test) is explicitly described in the text for the enrichment analyses.  
- No multiple‑testing correction such as FDR is mentioned; only a nominal p‑value threshold (p < 0.05) appears in some contexts.
