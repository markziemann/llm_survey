Thinking...
We need to parse article. The methods for pathway enrichment: In "miR-SNP association" section of Methods: after miR-SNP analysis, they performed pathway analyses. Let's locate text: In Methods section, after miR-SNP analysis, they say: "There were 255 target genes with 3' UTR miR-SNPs associated at P < 0.01 in the genome-wide analysis that were used as input for pathway analyses. These genes were overrepresented in five pathways in PANTHER (Table 4)." Wait need to find exact text: In Methods they said: "The miR-SNP analysis ... These genes were overrepresented in five pathways in PANTHER (Table 4)." Let's look at Methods part: The article snippet: In "miR‐SNP association" they mention: "These genes were overrepresented in five pathways in PANTHER (Table 4)." The method: "These genes were overrepresented in five pathways in PANTHER (Table 4)." We need to find the exact description of pathway enrichment analysis in Methods.

Search in Methods section for "pathway" phrase: In the Methods, under "miR-SNP association", they wrote: "These genes were overrepresented in five pathways in PANTHER (Table 4)." Also they may have described: "Statistical overrepresentation tests of top miR-SNP hits yielded two receptor-mediated signaling pathways." In Results: "These genes were overrepresented in five pathways in PANTHER (Table 4)." Also they mention "statistical overrepresentation tests of top miR-SNP hits yielded two receptor-mediated signaling pathways". The specific test: In Table 4 footnote: "P-value (FDR)". The description: "Statistical overrepresentation tests of top miR-SNP hits yielded two receptor-mediated signaling pathways". In Methods: "Pathway analyses were performed using PANTHER". Let's find the exact phrasing: In Methods, after miR-SNP analysis they said: "There were 255 target genes with 3’ UTR miR‑SNPs associated at P < 0.01 in the genome‑wide analysis that were used as input for pathway analyses. These genes were overrepresented in five pathways in PANTHER (Table 4)." That seems to be the description.

Thus we can answer:

Tool used: PANTHER (for pathway enrichment analysis). Possibly also "PANTHER Pathway" as library.

Version: Not described.

Gene set libraries: "PANTHER Pathway", "GO Cellular Component", "Reactome Pathway". These are listed in Table 4.

Custom background: They used "custom or specific background gene list"? Not described. In Methods they didn't specify background. So answer "Not described".

Statistical test: They used "Fisher's exact test". In Results: "Statistical overrepresentation tests ...". The article explicitly says "statistical overrepresentation tests". Not explicit which test, but in Table footnote they note "P‑value (FDR)". However we need to identify test name. The article says "statistical overrepresentation tests of top miR‑SNP hits". It does not specify test name. Might be hypergeometric, but not described. So answer "Not described".

Multiple testing correction: Yes, they mention "FDR" in Table 4: "P‑value (FDR)". So they applied FDR. So answer Yes.

Thus produce table with rows for each question.

Let's craft answer.
