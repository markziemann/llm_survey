Based on the information provided from the scientific article, here is an examination of how pathway enrichment analysis was conducted:

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - The tool used for pathway enrichment analysis was PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships).

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**
   - No specific version number of the PANTHER tool is mentioned in the text.

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**
   - The gene sets queried included those from Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - Yes, the entire genome was used as a reference set for GO terms.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**
   - The specific statistical tests are not described in detail in the article provided.

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - Yes, a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05 or less was applied for significance.

Here is how this information can be tabulated:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Tool Used | PANTHER |
| Tool Version Number | Not described |
| Gene Set Library Queried | GO, KEGG |
| Background Gene List Defined | Yes (entire genome for GO) |
| Statistical Test Used | Not described |
| FDR Correction Used | Yes (cutoff of 0.05 or less) |

This table summarizes the pathway enrichment analysis details as described in the article.
