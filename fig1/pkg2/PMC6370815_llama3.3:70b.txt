Here are the answers to the questions about pathway enrichment analysis:

1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?
The tools used for pathway enrichment analysis were R-package piano_1.16.4 and the "User data mapping" tool on the KEGG website.

2. Was a tool version number provided?
Yes, the version number of the R-package piano was provided as 1.16.4, and the version of the statistical software R was 3.4.1.

3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?
The gene set libraries queried were Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).

4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?
Yes, the background gene list was defined as the whole gene sets with corresponding Entrez-IDs of the Agilent 8 Ã— 60K Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray.

5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?
The statistical test used for enrichment analysis was Fisher's exact test.

6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?
Yes, Benjamini-Hochberg correction was used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis.
