Here is the information extracted and collated from the article (4.6) was used to extract the proteins. After extraction, the proteins were separated by SCX fractionation. 20 min, and the supernatant was collected.

   The protein pellets were dissolved in solubilizing buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS and 40 mM Tris-HCl. The sample was dissolved in
   (acetone. 15 °C for 2 h. The samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min and the supernatant was collected.  The samples were dissolved in 4% SDS and then the samples were labeled with
   urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, and 30 mM Tris-HCl. After the samples
   were extracted, the samples were dissolved in buffer A and B. The sample was dissolved in solubilizing buffer and the supernatant was collected and separated. The
   3 s, pulse-off 2 s. The sample was collected and the supernatant was collected and dissolved in solubilizing buffer. The
   supernatant was collected and the sample was dissolved in solubilizing buffer. After the samples were centrifuged, the samples were separated and
   collected and dissolved in solubilizing buffer. The samples were dissolved in
   solubilizing buffer. The sample was centrifuged and the supernatant was collected and
   and dissolved in solubilizing buffer. The sample was dissolved in solubilizing buffer and the supernatant was collected and the
   samples were separated. The samples were collected and dissolved in solubilizing buffer and the supernatant was collected.
   The samples were dissolved in solubilizing buffer and the supernatant was
   collected. The samples were collected and dissolved in solubilizing buffer. The samples were
   dissolved in solubilizing buffer and the supernatant was collected. The samples were collected and dissolved in
   solubilizing buffer. The samples were collected and dissolved in solubilizing buffer. The samples were dissolved in
   solubilizing buffer. The samples were collected and dissolved in solubilizing buffer. The samples were collected and dissolved in solubilizing
   was measured by the Bradford method.
