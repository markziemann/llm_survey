Abstract

Background

   Meat quality related phenotypes are difficult and expensive to measure
   and predict but are ideal candidates for genomic selection if genetic
   markers that account for a worthwhile proportion of the phenotypic
   variation can be identified. The objectives of this study were: 1) to
   perform genome wide association analyses for Warner-Bratzler Shear
   Force (WBSF), marbling, cooking loss, tenderness, juiciness, connective
   tissue and flavor; 2) to determine enriched pathways present in each
   genome wide association analysis; and 3) to identify potential
   candidate genes with multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated
   with meat quality.

Results

   The WBSF, marbling and cooking loss traits were measured in longissimus
   dorsi muscle from 672 steers. Out of these, 495 animals were used to
   measure tenderness, juiciness, connective tissue and flavor by a
   sensory panel. All animals were genotyped for 221,077 markers and
   included in a genome wide association analysis. A total number of 68
   genomic regions covering 52 genes were identified using the whole
   genome association approach; 48% of these genes encode transmembrane
   proteins or membrane associated molecules. Two enrichment analysis were
   performed: a tissue restricted gene enrichment applying a correlation
   analysis between raw associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
   by trait, and a functional classification analysis performed using the
   DAVID Bioinformatic Resources 6.8 server. The tissue restricted gene
   enrichment approach identified eleven pathways including “Endoplasmic
   reticulum membrane” that influenced multiple traits simultaneously. The
   DAVID functional classification analysis uncovered eleven clusters
   related to transmembrane or structural proteins. A gene network was
   constructed where the number of raw associated uncorrelated SNPs for
   each gene across all traits was used as a weight. A multiple SNP
   association analysis was performed for the top five most connected
   genes in the gene-trait network. The gene network identified the EVC2,
   ANXA10 and PKHD1 genes as potentially harboring multiple QTLs.
   Polymorphisms identified in structural proteins can modulate two
   different processes with direct effect on meat quality: in vivo myocyte
   cytoskeletal organization and postmortem proteolysis.

Conclusion

   The main result from the present analysis is the uncovering of several
   candidate genes associated with meat quality that have structural
   function in the skeletal muscle.

Background

   Beef consumers are highly interested in meat quality which is a complex
   of traits including tenderness, juiciness and flavor [[34]1–[35]3]. To
   respond to consumer demand, beef producers and retailers are interested
   in providing a consistent high-quality product [[36]4] which requires a
   reliable and efficient method of measuring the quality of the final
   product. Beef quality grade is used to categorize carcasses and
   communicate the quality to consumers. Quality grade is determined
   predominantly by marbling; however, marbling only explains 5% of the
   variation in product palatability across carcasses [[37]5]. Marbling
   and WBSF were identified from an extensive set of carcass and meat
   composition traits to be the best predictors of eating quality [[38]6].
   All the components defining the meat quality complex are quantitative
   traits, controlled by many genes and impacted by environmental factors.
   Most of these component traits are difficult and expensive to measure
   and not available to measure until late in life or after the animal has
   been harvested. Such traits are impractical to improve through
   traditional phenotypic selection but are ideal candidates for genomic
   selection if genetic markers that account for a worthwhile proportion
   of the phenotypic variation can be identified.

   Genome wide association (GWA) studies have revealed well-supported
   associations, but these analyses generally explain only a small
   proportion of the phenotypic variance [[39]7] because they can only
   identify genetic variants with medium to large effect. McClure et al.
   (2012) [[40]8] analyzed five Bos taurus breeds and reported that only
   1.02 and 1.85% of the observed phenotypic variation in WBSF could be
   explained by variation in calpastatin and μ-calpain genes,
   respectively, two major genes extensively analyzed in relationships
   with tenderness. Additional approaches, such as gene enrichment, have
   been designed to help identify genes with small to medium effect in an
   effort to understand the genetic basis of complex traits like beef
   palatability and meat quality [[41]9]. The objectives of this study
   were: 1) to perform a GWA analysis for WBSF, marbling, cooking loss,
   tenderness, juiciness, connective tissue and flavor; 2) to determine
   enriched pathways in each GWA analysis; and 3) to identify candidate
   genes with multiple QTLs associated with meat quality.

Results

Phenotypes

   Additive genetic differences and heterosis effect for carcass and meat
   palatability traits were estimated in this population previously
   [[42]10]. The estimated heritabilities for marbling, tenderness and
   WBSF were 0.50 ± 0.05, 0.47 ± 0.06 and 0.17 ± 0.03, respectively, and
   the additive genetic correlation between WBSF and tenderness was
   − 0.97 ± 0.01 [[43]11]. Table [44]1 shows the basic statistics for the
   meat quality phenotypes available for this study.

Tissue restricted gene enrichment

   The tissue restricted gene enrichment approach identified the
   “Endoplasmic reticulum membrane”, “Negative regulation of transcription
   from RNA polymerase II promoter”, “Positive regulation of transcription
   from RNA polymerase II promoter”, and “Guanosine-5’-triphosphate (GTP)
   binding” pathways for more than one trait simultaneously (Fig. [54]3).
   Additionally, six other pathways were identified as enriched for a
   single trait (Additional file [55]3).

   classification analysis (e)

DAVID functional classification analysis

   Twenty-one genes were identified through the functional classification
   analysis based on DAVID in at least four traits (Fig. [58]3e and
   Additional file [59]4). Many of these genes, such as EPHA7, NRXN2,
   CADM1, PALLD, and VCAN, encode integral components of membranes, or are
   protein extracellular matrix constituents.

   associated uncorrelated SNPs across all traits. The top five genes in
   the network had a significantly higher connectivity than the rest of
   the genes and they are discussed below.

Discussion

Phenotypes

   The average marbling score was 425.57 ± 90.03 which is comparable to
   the national beef industry average quality [[63]12] and similar to
   previously reported data in this multibreed population [[64]10, [65]13,
   [66]14]. Based on the taste panel measurements, steaks were classified
   on average as slightly tender and slightly juicy. Flavor was moderately
   intense and only traces of connective tissue were perceived by
   panelists during the sensory panel.

Genomic regions detected by the genome wide association analysis

Genomic regions associated with WBSF

   Four chromosomal regions were associated with WBSF and harbored the
   RWDD4A, NUMBL, BLMH, SMG6 and LRP5 genes. The LRP5 is a cell-surface
   co-receptor of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and has a pivotal role in
   bone formation. Polymorphisms in LRP5 can modulate the relationship
   between physical activity and bone density suggesting that LRP5 may
   play a role in bone mechanical load adaptation. Thus, LRP5 could be
   involved in bone/muscle cross-talk through the Wnt signaling [[67]15].
   Basic and clinical research on bone metabolism and muscle biology
   suggests that bone interacts with skeletal muscle via signaling from
   local and humoral factors [[68]16]. A chromosomic region harboring LRP5
   was associated with fatty acid composition and WBSF in longissimus
   muscle from Bos taurus [[69]17, [70]18].

   A number of studies have reported associations of polymorphisms in
   μ-calpain and calpastatin with tenderness, and several of these
   polymorphisms had a large effect in Bos taurus populations [[71]8,
   [72]18–[73]20]. In the present study, no association was found between
   meat quality related traits and μ-calpain or calpastatin, which could
   be explained by the Bos indicus influence [[74]21]. This reconfirms
   that genetic markers discovered in Bos taurus populations are usually
   not predictive in Bos indicus populations most likely due to changes in
   size effect and stringent p-value corrections applied in GWA
   approaches. In the same population used in this study, Leal-Gutiérrez
   et al. [[75]22] reported multiple polymorphisms in the 3′ region of
   calpastatin associated with WBSF, however, none of them had a large
   individual effect. Additionally, in the same population, Wright et al.
   [[76]23] found that μ-calpain autolysis was related to troponin-T,
   desmin, and titin degradation, and these were related to variation in
   WBSF and taste panel tenderness.

Genomic regions associated with marbling

   Three genomic regions (2:7,343,971 – 7,437,564, 5:47,654,327 –
   47,827,349, 11:27,755,975 – 27,894,797, and 19:56,569,168 – 56,584,509)
   had at least two SNPs associated with marbling. The COL3A1 gene located
   on BTA2 encodes a collagen protein that is more abundant in soft
   connective tissues [[77]24]. Higher fat and collagen deposition in
   skeletal muscle is observed in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients,
   and it has been suggested that a common mesenchymal progenitor cell is
   responsible for fat and fibrosis accumulation in skeletal muscle. This
   relationship between fat and fibrosis accumulation could impact meat
   quality perception. However, it is unclear how adipocytes or
   collagen-producing cells are regulated before differentiation from
   mesenchymal progenitors [[78]25]. Other previously reported genes of
   this family associated with marbling are: COL11A1, COL15A1, COL1A1,
   COL24A1, COL28A, COL2A1, COL4A3, COL6A3 and COL23A1 [[79]19, [80]21].

   Four genes (GRIP1, HELB, FAU and IRAK3) are located on BTA5 between
   47,654,327 – 47,827,349. With the exception of FAU, all other genes had
   at least one SNP associated with marbling. The GRIP1 is a steroid
   receptor coactivator involved in nuclear receptor-mediated activation
   of transcription. It activates myogenin, MEF-2, p21, and also promotes
   expression of contractile proteins and myotube formation. Thus, GRIP1
   is involved in myocyte differentiation [[81]26–[82]28]. The HELB
   encodes a 5–3 DNA Helicase important for DNA damage response [[83]29].
   The SRBD1 and ENSBTAG00000032651 genes are located inside the
   11:27,755,975 – 27,894,797 chromosomic region which has two associated
   SNPs. No conclusive biological support for this association was
   evident; nevertheless, neighboring regions have been previously
   reported as associated with fatty acid composition in longissimus
   muscle from Bos taurus and Bos indicus cattle [[84]17, [85]30].

   One region on BTA19 harboring RECQL5, SMIM5 and ENSBTAG00000011713
   genes was associated with marbling. The RECQL5 is involved in DNA
   replication, transcription and repair. The role of RECQL5 in
   transcription has been related to inhibition of stalled transcript
   elongation at damaged DNA sites by binding to the RNA polymerase II
   [[86]31]. The SMIM5 and ENSBTAG00000011713 encode structural proteins
   in skeletal muscle. This region in the BTA19 has been previously
   reported as associated with carcass and meat quality, fatty acid
   composition, and mineral and peptide content [[87]17, [88]18].

Genomic regions associated with cooking loss

   A genomic region on BTA5 (105,049,390 - 105,291,830) showed a highly
   significant association with cooking loss. Two SNPs in this region were
   significant at the genome wide p-value threshold, while other five SNPs
   were significant at the 0.1 × 10^− 3 threshold. Two genes are located
   in this region: ANO2 and NTF3 (Fig. [89]1). The ANO2 is an
   intracellular calcium activated chloride channel [[90]32]. The NTF3
   belongs to the Neurotrophic Factor family which modulates survival and
   function by innervating motoneurons and proprioceptive neurons. The
   Neurotrophic Factor family is also involved in myoblast and muscle
   fiber development and differentiation, muscle innervation coordination
   and functional differentiation of neuromuscular junctions [[91]33].
   Mice lacking one NTF3 functional gene copy had smaller cross-sectional
   fiber area, and fibers were more densely packed than in the wild type
   phenotype. Adult NTF3 deficient mice showed weaker movement compared to
   wild type when exposed to electrical stimulation [[92]34]. These
   results indicate that NTF3 is involved in nerve terminal maturation and
   synaptic vesicle recycling, and changes to these processes can lead to
   changes in muscle fiber diameter. The Additional file [93]5 shows the
   ANO2-NTF3 region in detail and the SNPs associated with cooking loss.
   Although the associated SNPs are evenly distributed outside and inside
   several LD-blocks, they are highly correlated, as shown on the SNP
   correlation heat map. The distribution of these SNPs suggests the
   presence of a single, unique QTL for cooking loss located downstream
   from ANO2. When the most significant SNP in this region, rs137723969,
   was fitted as a fixed effect in the GWA analysis, all remaining SNPs
   inside this region lost their significance. The rs137723969 SNP is a
   T/C intronic substitution, thus, it could have a regulatory function or
   it might be in strong LD with the functional polymorphism.

   Two other genomic regions on BTA 4 and BTA 13 were associated with
   cooking loss. The BTA 4 region 40,441,870 - 40,454,953 had two
   associated SNPs located in the ENSBTAG00000047646 gene. This gene is
   the bovine orthologue of the human CD36. The CD36 is a multifunctional
   glycoprotein, and its molecular function is to be a receptor for a
   broad range of ligands, from fibronectin and collagen to low-density
   lipoprotein, anionic phospholipids, and long-chain fatty acids
   [[94]35]. The CD36 regulates plasma membrane fatty acid transport and
   has been found responsible for an increased passage of fatty acids in
   obese and insulin resistant people. This higher rate of transport
   contributes to the increased accumulation rates of triacylglycerol in
   skeletal muscle through a critical role in regulation of fatty acid
   esterification and oxidation performed by CD36 [[95]36]. The
   association of this region with cooking loss could be related to
   changes in fatty acid deposition and/or composition and its loss as
   fluid during cooking. Mateescu, Garrick, & Reecy [[96]18] reported
   association of a region located 0.6 megabases downstream of CD36 with a
   panel of carcass and meat quality traits, mineral and peptide content
   and fatty acid composition. The second region is located between
   13:60,209,040 and 13:60,210,256, and three associated SNPs are located
   inside the SIRPD; however, no conclusive biological support was
   evident.

   The CHSY3 and PREX2 genes were also found associated with cooking loss.
   The former gene encodes a transmembrane protein associated to the Golgi
   apparatus. Dang et al. [[97]37] and Chen et al. [[98]17] found
   association of chromosomic regions close to CHSY3 and PREX2 with
   tenderness and fatty acid content in Bos taurus, respectively.

Genomic regions associated with tenderness

   Four genes (CFAP54, GPR98, TUT1 and SLC47A1) were associated with
   sensory tenderness. The CFAP54 and GPR98 are integral components of
   structural proteins and membranes. The GPR98 has been associated with
   bone density, levels of serum osteocalcin, bone formation marker, and
   urine deoxypyridinoline in human and confirmed in mice [[99]38]. Some
   GPR98 neighboring regions have been reported as associated with
   multiple carcass and meat quality traits, and fatty acids composition.
   The biological function of TUT1 is related to synthesis of the
   3-poly(A) tail and 3’end cleavage of specific pre-mRNAs, and this
   region has been reported as associated with fatty acid composition
   [[100]17, [101]39].

Genomic regions associated with juiciness

   One marker located at 28:41,901,391 and mapped to the MMRN2 gene was
   highly associated with juiciness. This gene encodes an extracellular
   matrix glycoprotein, and although its biological role has remained
   elusive, it is believed to be a key component in endothelial cell
   function regulation, neoangiogenesis and tumor growth [[102]40]. Chen
   et al. [[103]17] and Castro et al. [[104]41] reported association of
   neighboring regions to MMRN2 with fatty acid composition and WBSF in
   longissimus muscle from Bos taurus and Bos indicus.

   Four SNPs in regions 45,889,900 – 45,964,845 and 47,514,682 –
   47,523,394 on BTA19 were associated with juiciness. The
   ENSBTAG00000044940 and GOSR2 genes are located inside the first region
   while METTL2 gene is located inside the second. The GOSR2 gene is
   involved in the transport of critical membrane glycoprotein complexes
   in myocytes [[105]42]. In humans, double Gly144Trp mutants in GOSR2 had
   progressive cortical myoclonus and ataxia with areflexia, showing
   reduced motor unit recruitment given chronic partial denervation
   [[106]43]. A GOSR2 neighboring region has been reported as associated
   with oleic acid content in Japanese Black cattle [[107]44]. One exonic
   SNP in LIG1 was found associated with juiciness, and a window including
   this region has been previously reported as associated with WBSF
   [[108]8].

Genomic regions associated with connective tissue

   One region on BTA18 was associated with the connective tissue amount,
   and this region harbors CNOT3, OSCAR and NLRP5 genes. The CNOT3 is a
   component of the CCR4-NOT complex. This complex codes for major mRNA
   deadenylases, and it is linked to numerous cellular processes such as
   miRNA-mediated repression, bulk mRNA degradation, general transcription
   regulation and translational repression during translational initiation
   [[109]45]. Morita et al. [[110]46] documented that expression of two
   CNOT3 regulated genes, PDK4 and IGFBP1, are increased in Cnot3+/−
   hepatocytes since they have longer poly(A) tails than those seen in the
   control. Additionally, the increased expression of CNOT3 target genes
   was associated with greatly decreased visceral and subcutaneous fat
   deposition in Cnot3+/− mice. The OSCAR is an osteoclastogenesis
   regulator and plays an important bone-specific function in osteoclast
   differentiation [[111]47]. The ATRNL1 and NFIB were found associated
   with connective tissue, and Chen et al. [[112]17] and Saatchi et al.
   [[113]48] reported association of a chromosomic region close to these
   genes with fatty acid composition in Bos taurus cattle.

Genomic regions associated with flavor

   Flavor had three associated SNPs in MARCO, ZMYND8 and ACCN1. The ZMYND8
   may act as a transcriptional corepressor of the KDM5D, and since KDM5D
   is a histone demethylase that specifically demethylates Lys-4 of
   histone H3, ZMYND8 plays a central role in histone modifications
   [[114]49]. Chen et al. [[115]17] reported association of a 0.4
   megabases downstream region of the ACCN1 associated SNP with fatty acid
   composition in Bos taurus; nevertheless, no biological support for this
   association was found.

Enriched pathways related to meat quality

Tissue restricted gene enrichment

   The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane pathway was enriched for WBSF,
   cooking loss, tenderness, juiciness, and connective tissue.
   Figure [116]3a shows the number of genes in each enriched pathway for
   each trait. Five genes (SEC16B, REEP1, SLC8A3, TMEM147 and CD4) were
   identified in the ER membrane pathway for at least three traits
   simultaneously. The SEC16B is required for secretory cargo traffic from
   the ER to the Golgi apparatus and for normal transitional ER
   organization [[117]50]. The REEP1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein
   required by ER-cytoskeleton network formation, shaping and remodeling
   [[118]51]. The electrogenic exchange of Ca(2+) against Na(+) ions
   across the cell membrane is performed by SLC8A3 and contributes to the
   cytoplasmic regulation of Ca(2+) levels, Ca(2+)-dependent cellular
   processes and to cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis in excitable cells such as
   myocytes. The SLC8A3 gene was included in the “transmembrane signaling
   receptor activity” and “extracellular matrix structural constituent” GO
   terms [[119]52, [120]53].

   Many proteins in this pathway are structural constituents of the ER,
   and their implication in meat quality could be hypothesized through
   changes in ER macrostructure and cytoskeletal binding. Some human
   hereditary spastic paraplegias result from mutations in REEP1 which is
   required for ER network formation [[121]51]. The REEP1 is structurally
   related to the DP1/Yop1p family of ER-shaping proteins, and it
   colocalizes and forms protein complexes with spastin and atlastin-1.
   Hydrophobic residues in REEP are critical in supporting membrane
   curvature [[122]54]. A mutant REEP1 protein lacking the C-terminal
   cytoplasmic region, disrupts the ER network in vitro, demonstrating
   that REEP1 binds to microtubules and aligns along the microtubule
   cytoskeleton [[123]51]. Overexpression of REEP1 dramatically alters ER
   morphology because this protein has ER-shaping and ER-remodeling
   function by interacting directly with microtubules [[124]51]. The
   “Endomembrane system” and “Golgi apparatus” GO terms was identified as
   enriched following a GWA analysis for WBSF in Nelore cattle [[125]41],
   showing the importance of structural proteins for the cytoskeletal
   myocyte framework and tenderness. Proteins in this pathway could be
   related to proteolysis. The tenderization process is determined by the
   amount of disruption of cytoskeletal proteins such as desmin,
   metavinculin, nebulin, dystrophin and vinculin by μ-calpain
   [[126]55–[127]58]. Nevertheless, transmembrane proteins such as TMEM147
   and CD4 could be membrane anchors of the cytoskeletal proteins to the
   plasma and organelle membranes, thus their proteolysis may be critical
   for tenderization. Giving that REEP1 is not a μ-calpain substrate
   (Additional file [128]6), this protein may be important for cellular
   compartmentalization or increased cytoskeletal stability after aging.

   The ZMYND11, PDE2A, GLIS2, GLI2, and HMGA2 genes from the “negative
   regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter” pathway
   were enriched for connective tissue and marbling. Three genes (CDH13,
   NKX3–1, and PARK2) from the “positive regulation of transcription from
   RNA polymerase II promoter” pathway were also identified as enriched
   for connective tissue and flavor simultaneously (Fig. [129]3b and d).
   The ZMYND11 is a chromatin reader, and it specifically recognizes and
   binds to histone 3. It regulates RNA polymerase II elongation and
   colocalizes with highly expressed genes acting as a transcription
   corepressor by restraining RNA polymerase II at the elongation stage
   [[130]59]. The PDE2A has phosphodiesterase activity, and it is involved
   in cAMP (cyclic adenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate) catabolism and signal
   transduction [[131]60]. The GLIS2 and GLI2 are hedgehog signaling
   pathway regulators, and HMGA2 modulates transcriptional processes and
   plays a role in postnatal myogenesis and satellite cell activation
   [[132]61]. The CDH13 encodes a protein localized to the surface of the
   cell membrane, and it is hypermethylated in some types of cancer, the
   NKX3–1 transcription factor behaves as a repressor, and PARK2 protein
   can repress p53/TP53 protecting against apoptosis [[133]62].

   The relation of these two pathways with meat quality traits can be
   explained through changes in the expression of genes related to
   connective and adipose tissue deposition. A nephronophthisis-like
   phenotype in human and mice was found associated with a mutation in the
   GLIS2 gene [[134]63], with severe renal fibrosis and atrophy resulting
   from upregulation of fibrosis related genes and increased apoptosis in
   the GLIS2 mutant kidneys. Overexpression of HMGA2 has been found in
   activated myosatellite cells; however, gene expression declines
   significantly as fusion of myoblasts into myotubes proceeds and also
   during muscle regeneration [[135]64, [136]65]. It has been documented
   that HMGA2 is located inside a QTL for lean mass percentage, growth and
   back fat in longissimus muscle from swine [[137]66].

   The ERAL1, GMPPB and LRRK2 genes were enriched in the GTP binding
   pathway for cooking loss and marbling (Fig. [138]3c). The ERAL1 encodes
   a GTPase involved protein required for assembly of the mitochondrial
   ribosomal small subunit. The LRRK2 has GTPase activity [[139]67]. Some
   dominant mutations in the human GMPPB associated with defects in
   protein glycosylation have been identified [[140]68]. These defects
   result in morphological changes in the neuronal membrane, and
   dystrophic changes are evident with ring fibers, increased fibrosis,
   necrosis, and multiple regenerating fibers and abnormal neuromuscular
   transmission in muscle. Some of these mutations lead to abnormal GMPPB
   folding, which results in cytoplasm protein aggregates [[141]69]. An
   associated cluster of GDP (Guanosine-5′-diphosphate)-GTP
   (Guanosine-5′-triphosphate) conversion related genes on BTA5 and
   “GTPase binding” enrichment have been reported for meat quality in
   Nelore populations [[142]41, [143]70].

DAVID functional classification analysis

   The EPHA7 and NRXN2 genes were found across all five phenotypes and are
   expressed in bovine skeletal muscle. The EPHA7 encodes a tyrosine
   kinase receptor involved in cell signaling and modulation of cell-cell
   adhesion [[144]71]. Vickerman et al. and Lai et al. [[145]72, [146]73]
   showed that EPHA7 is co-localized at the neuromuscular junction of
   adult muscle being physically associated with the actin cytoskeleton.
   Changes in NRXN2 expression in motor neurons have been reported as the
   cause of spinal muscular atrophy in mammals [[147]74]. Only four genes
   in the ER membrane pathway were found in common between the tissue
   restricted gene enrichment analysis and the DAVID functional
   classification analysis (TYRO3, BCL2, POMGNT2 and PTGS1). The TYRO3 is
   an integral component of plasma membrane, ER membrane and nucleus. The
   BCL2 is not a membrane bound protein but it is found in mitochondrion
   and ER. Both TYRO3 and BCL2 are involved in cell survival and
   apoptosis. The POMGNT2 protein is an integral component of the ER
   membrane with transferase activity.

Gene network and candidate genes with multiple QTLs across meat quality
traits

   The EVC2 gene had the highest connectivity in the network.
   Additional file [148]7 shows the SNP association plot and the LD-block
   prediction for this gene. The EVC2 encodes a positive regulator of the
   hedgehog signaling pathway, and it has a critical role in skeletal
   development and bone formation [[149]75]. Hedgehog signaling modulates
   patterning and morphogenesis of most organs in mammalian embryo, and
   mutations in EVC or EVC2 disrupt the hedgehog signaling in bone
   development, with a high proportion of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome
   patients presenting mutations in EVC2 [[150]76]. Tenderness, cooking
   loss and juiciness had two, three and three raw associated uncorrelated
   SNPs in EVC2, respectively. When fitted together in the association
   model, only one SNP was significant for tenderness, two for cooking
   loss (rs455584405 and rs43488309) and other two SNPs (rs43488309 and
   rs383679972) for juiciness (Additional files [151]7 and [152]8). The
   LD-block prediction for EVC2 revealed that these pairs of SNPs
   significant for each trait were located in different LD-blocks. This
   suggests that different segments of EVC2 contribute independently to
   the phenotypic variability present in cooking loss and juiciness in the
   present population.

   The bioinformatic analysis of these SNPs revealed that the C allele of
   rs455584405 reduces the Minimum Free Energy (MFE) parameter by
   4.1 kcal/mol, which was the largest impact on MFE from the entire set
   of SNPs. The missense rs455584405 SNP produces a E6D change in the EVC2
   protein. The EVC2 is a transmembrane protein, with a cytoplasmic
   portion encoded by the 1 to 196 amino acids, the transmembrane portion
   located between the amino acids 197 and 221, and the remaining
   representing the extracellular region. No signal peptide was predicted
   for this protein and the E6D change does not have an effect on the EVC2
   isoelectric point. Thus, a possible change in the interaction between
   the cytoplasmic portion of EVC2 and other cytoskeletal compounds could
   explain this association. The rs43488309 marker is a synonymous SNP,
   and the C > T change produces a reduction of 3.2 kcal/mol in MFE and
   minimal changes in mRNA folding.

   The ANXA10 and PALLD are contiguous genes located on BTA8
   (Additional file [153]9). ANXA10, a constituent of the multigene
   Annexins family, is a Ca2 + −regulated phospholipid- and
   membrane-binding protein. This family has been described as involved in
   diverse biological mechanisms from the control of membrane structure to
   certain membrane transport processes [[154]77]. The PALLD gene encodes
   a cytoskeletal protein essential for normal cytoskeletal organization
   and involved in establishing cell morphology, cell adhesion and
   motility, and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. PALLD functions
   as a scaffolding molecule affecting actin polymerization and actin
   filament assembly [[155]78]. ANXA10 showed a higher LD level that the
   PALLD locus. This might suggest that more markers are required to map
   QTLs in PALLD. A total of seven SNPs in ANXA10 were identified as raw
   associated uncorrelated SNPs for WBSF (2 SNPs), marbling (2 SNPs) and
   cooking loss (3 SNPs). However, only two SNPs for WBSF, and only one
   SNP for marbling and cooking loss are required to explain all the
   variability in the ANXA10-PALLD region. The two indels (rs110953884 SNP
   and rs464042833) significant for WBSF are located in intronic regions
   of ANXA10; thus, they could map neighboring functional polymorphisms or
   have a regulatory function in this gene.

   The PKHD1 gene (Additional file [156]10) encodes a membrane and
   cytoskeleton associated binding protein related to the “positive
   regulation of cell proliferation” and “single organismal cell-cell
   adhesion” pathways. Several phenotypes are associated with mutations in
   PKHD1: congenital hepatic fibrosis, biliary tract abnormality and
   absence of renal corticomedullary differentiation [[157]79–[158]81].
   Although this gene has not been associated with any skeletal muscle
   related phenotype, it is expressed at a low level in skeletal muscle
   [[159]82]. The PKHD1 locus is in a low LD region with the possibility
   of multiple QTLs. All three raw uncorrelated SNPs associated with WBSF
   were significant when fitted simultaneously, as was the case with the
   two significant SNPs for flavor. The existence of several associated
   SNPs in different LD-blocks of PKHD1 indicate that different regions of
   this gene could contribute independently to tenderness and flavor in
   the present population.

   The PKHD1 protein contains an intracellular segment (3873–4071 amino
   acids), a transmembrane segment between 3850 and 3872, and an
   extracellular segment. The bioinformatics analysis predicted a signal
   peptide between amino acids 1–17. Three SNPs (rs43559996, rs209661307
   and rs714029807) were significant when fitted simultaneously for
   tenderness, while two other SNPs (rs208145052 and rs718439487) were
   significant for flavor. The bioinformatic analysis identified only 2 of
   these SNPs (rs43559996 and rs209661307) as able to modify the MFE
   parameter (by 3.4 and 1.3 kcal/mol, respectively) and have the biggest
   impact on mRNA folding. All five SNPs are missense polymorphisms
   (Additional file [160]8), and they are able to change the isoelectric
   point parameter by 0.01. The rs714029807, rs718439487, rs208145052,
   rs209661307 SNPs are located in the extracellular segment of PKHD1 and
   rs43559996 is found in the cytoplasmic portion. Thus, all these SNPs
   might affect the physical relationship between PKHD1 and the
   extracellular matrix and other cytoskeletal proteins.

   ENSBTAG00000020151 gene codes for a protein with nucleic acid binding
   activity [[161]83] (Additional file [162]11), but its specific function
   has not been clearly identified. Two associated uncorrelated SNPs
   associated with marbling are located inside the first LD block;
   however, only one is able to explain all the variability present in
   this region when both are fitted simultaneously in the model. Two
   uncorrelated SNPs in this gene were found associated with cooking loss
   and flavor but in both cases one SNP is able to explain all the
   variability present in each trait.

Biological mechanisms associated with meat quality

   Multiple myocyte structural proteins and related pathways were
   identified in the present analysis. From the 52 genes identified in the
   GWA approach, 48% encode transmembrane proteins or membrane associated
   molecules and 5.7% encode cytoskeletal proteins. Genes in the
   Endoplasmic reticulum membrane, Golgi apparatus, GTP binding and
   Mitochondrial inner membrane were enriched, and clustering of the same
   type of proteins was evident using the functional classification
   analysis. Polymorphisms in genes coding for structural proteins can
   modulate two different processes with direct effect on meat quality: in
   vivo myocyte cytoskeletal organization and postmortem proteolysis.

   From the genes associated with the in vivo myocyte cytoskeletal
   organization, EHD, BNIP3, MARCO and COL5A1 are the most interesting and
   are discussed further. The EHD gene is involved in receptor and lipid
   recycling in plasma membrane and promotes cytoskeletal reorganization
   and tubule formation; EHD also physically interacts with myoferlin, a
   protein involved in myoblast fusion [[163]84]. The myoblasts of the
   EHD1 knockout mice showed impaired receptor recycling and key muscle
   protein misplacement [[164]84], resulting in muscles with reduced
   myoblast fusion, smaller myofibers and overgrown T-tubules. Defective
   EHD1 adipocytes have enlarged endosomes and cytoplasmic dispersion of
   perinuclear GLUT4-containing membranes [[165]85]. It was reported that
   EHD1 regulates transport of β1-integrin, a protein involved in multiple
   signaling pathways and a key for processes such as proliferation,
   apoptosis, cell spreading and migration [[166]86]. EHD1 knockdown
   produces impaired β1-integrin recycling and accumulation in a
   transferrin-containing endocytic recycling compartment. Fibroblastic
   plasma membranes from EHD1 knockouts had lower content of β1-integrin,
   more prominent focal adhesions, and diminished migration and cell
   spreading capacity. Activation and upregulation of the MARCO gene is
   associated with changes in actin cytoskeleton organization during
   cellular splenic maturation. Immature splenic dendritic cells are
   adherent and show visible actin structures while mature cells are
   nonadherent, round and have punctate actin cytoskeletal structure
   [[167]87]. The BNIP3 modulates actin cytoskeleton plasticity and
   knockdown of this gene results in a more stable tubular-like network,
   different actin cytoskeletal remodeling activity, upregulated formation
   of actin stress fibers, decreased lamellopodial protrusions and
   filopodia [[168]88]. In wild type fibroblasts, COLLV and COLLIII are
   arranged as large fibrils in the intercellular spaces but mutations in
   COL5A1 and COL3A1 alter collagen organization in the extracellular
   matrix and affect clustering of α2β1 integrin receptor. Mutations in
   COL5A1 and COL3A1 also promote collagen retention in the cytoplasm
   [[169]89].

   Polymorphisms in other structural proteins are associated with
   functional alterations. Yadav et al. [[170]90] reported that four
   mutations in GLURΔ1 trigger spontaneous gate opening. Mutations in
   C19ORF12 gene modifies protein location and function; C19ORF12 encodes
   a protein located in the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum
   membrane and mutations in this gene impair protein subcellular location
   and cellular response to oxidative stress [[171]91]. Activating
   mutations in PDGFRA have been identified in patients with
   gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Mutations in the PDGFRA transmembrane
   domain simulates dimer transmembrane domain packing and promotes cell
   growth and signaling in the absence of ligand [[172]92].

   The second mechanism is associated with the amount of structural
   protein disruption in the myocyte after aging. Meat quality is mainly
   determined by the extent of postmortem proteolysis of key cytoskeletal,
   cytoskeletal-associated proteins, and extracellular matrix-associated
   proteins. This proteolysis is accomplished by degradation of structural
   proteins such as desmin and talin during aging through the activity of
   the endogenous μ-calpain-calpastatin system [[173]93–[174]96].
   Filaments such as desmin and talin are the main substrates of this
   endogenous system, but membrane anchoring proteins identified in the
   present analysis might have a significant contribution. From a total of
   72 structural proteins identified as associated with meat quality
   traits in the present analysis (Additional file [175]6), 87.5% of these
   proteins are potential substrates of μ-calpain. Some previously
   reported membrane associated proteins and calpain substrates are:
   GIUR1, NR2A, CFTR and ITPR1 [[176]97–[177]101]. Many of these proteins
   anchor cytoskeletal filaments to the sarcolemma and organelle
   membranes, therefore the lysis of these proteins during proteolysis
   could have a direct effect on overall cytoskeletal stability.

Conclusion

   A total number of 68 genomic regions covering 52 genes were associated
   with meat quality traits and these genes are related to
   gene-expression, cell-signaling, cell-differentiation, and apoptosis;
   48% of these genes encode transmembrane proteins or membrane associated
   molecules and 5.7% encode cytoskeletal proteins. A tissue restricted
   gene enrichment identified two main kinds of pathways: pathways
   associated with membrane structural proteins such as Endoplasmic
   reticulum membrane, Golgi apparatus, GTP binding and Mitochondrial
   inner membrane, and pathways related to gene expression including
   Negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter,
   Positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter,
   Regulation of transcription, DNA-templated, RNA binding and
   Transcription DNA-templated. A DAVID functional classification analysis
   identified clusters mainly related to integral components of membranes.
   A gene network identified the EVC2, ANXA10 and PKHD1 as potential genes
   with multiple QTLs associated with meat quality.

   Polymorphisms in structural proteins can modulate two processes with
   direct effect on meat quality: in vivo myocyte cytoskeletal
   organization and postmortem proteolysis. Gene related to the first
   process such as EHD, BNIP3, MARCO and COL5A1 control cytoskeletal
   organization and remodeling, T-tubules growth and transport of other
   transmembrane proteins. During postmortem proteolysis, structural
   proteins are disrupted in the myocytes. Filaments such as desmin and
   talin are the main proteolysis substrates, but membrane anchoring
   proteins identified as associated in the present analysis might have a
   significant contribution. Out of 72 structural proteins identified as
   associated with meat quality traits in the present analysis, 87.5% are
   potential substrates of μ-calpain. Lysis of these proteins during
   proteolysis could have a direct effect on overall cytoskeletal
   stability giving that many of these proteins anchor cytoskeletal
   filaments to the sarcolemma and organelle membranes.

Methods

Cattle population and phenotypic data

   The research protocol was approved by the University of Florida
   Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee number 201003744. The
   animals were born between 2007 and 2014 and belong to the multibreed
   Angus-Brahman herd from the University of Florida [[178]102]. Cattle
   were classified into six different groups based on their expected Angus
   and Brahman breed composition. Based on the Angus composition, the
   grouping was as follows: 1 = 100 to 80%; 2 = 79 to 65%; 3 = 62.5%
   (Brangus); 4 = 59 to 40%; 5 = 39 to 20%; 6 = 19 to 0%.

   When steers reached 1.27 cm subcutaneous fat thickness over the ribeye,
   they were transported to a commercial packing plant with an average
   slaughter weight of 537.94 ± 55.31 kg at 17.31 ± 1.23 months. A total
   number of 672 steers were harvested using established USDA-FSIS
   procedures, and after 48 h postmortem, marbling was recorded by
   graders’ visual appraisal of the ribeye muscle at the cut surface after
   the carcass had been ribbed at the 12th/13th rib interface. The
   marbling grade was as follows: Practically Devoid = 100–199,
   Traces = 200–299, Slight = 300–399, Small = 400–499, Modest = 500–599,
   Moderate = 600–699, Slightly Abundant = 700–799, Moderately
   Abundant = 800–899, Abundant = 900–999. A Johnson normalization was
   applied to marbling [[179]103].

   Two 2.54 cm steaks from the longissimus dorsi muscle at the 12th/13th
   rib interface were sampled from each animal. Steaks were transported to
   the Meat Science Laboratory of the University of Florida, aged for
   14 days at 1 to 4 °C, and then stored at − 20 °C. Both frozen steaks
   from each animal were allowed to thaw at 4 °C for 24 h and cooked to an
   internal temperature of 71 °C on an open-hearth grill. After cooking,
   one steak was cooled at 4 °C for 18 to 24 h and used to measure WBSF
   and cooking loss according to the American Meat Science Association
   Sensory Guidelines [[180]104]. Six cores with a 1.27-cm diameter and
   parallel to the muscle fiber were sheared with a Warner-Bratzler head
   attached to an Instron Universal Testing Machine (model 3343; Instron
   Corporation, Canton, MA). The Warner-Bratzler head moved at a cross
   head speed of 200 mm/min. The average peak load (kg) of six cores from
   the same steak was calculated and the logarithm of WBSF was
   subsequently analyzed. The weight lost during cooking was recorded and
   cooking loss was expressed as a percentage of the cooked weight out of
   the thaw weight.

   The second steak was used to measure tenderness, juiciness, connective
   tissue and flavor by a sensory panel according to the American Meat
   Science Association Sensory Guidelines [[181]104]. The sensory panel
   consisted of eight to eleven trained members, and six animals were
   assessed per session. Two 1 × 2.54 cm samples from each steak were
   provided to each panelist. Sensory panel measurements analyzed by the
   sensory panelists included: tenderness (8 = extremely tender, 7 = very
   tender, 6 = moderately tender, 5 = slightly tender, 4 = slightly tough,
   3 = moderately tough, 2 = very tough, 1 = extremely tough), juiciness
   (8 = extremely juicy, 7 = very juicy, 6 = moderately juicy,
   5 = slightly juicy, 4 = slightly dry, 3 = moderately dry, 2 = very dry,
   1 = extremely dry), connective tissue (8 = none detected,
   7 = practically none, 6 = traces amount, 5 = slight amount,
   4 = moderate amount, 3 = slightly abundant, 2 = moderately abundant,
   1 = abundant amount), and flavor (8 = extremely intense, 7 = very
   intense, 6 = moderately intense, 5 = slightly intense, 4 = slightly
   bland, 3 = moderately bland, 2 = very bland, 1 = extremely bland). For
   each phenotype, the average of scores from all members of the panel was
   analyzed for each steak. The Johnson normalization was applied to
   connective tissue [[182]103].

Genotyping and data quality control

   Genomic DNA was extracted from blood using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue
   kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and stored at − 20 °C. All animals were
   genotyped with the commercial GGP Bovine F-250 chip (GeneSeek, Inc.,
   Lincoln, NE) which contains 221,077 single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs). A total number of 115,287 SNPs were included in the GWAs after
   excluding markers with a minor allele frequency lower than 0.05 and a
   calling rate smaller than 0.9. Samples with calling rates smaller than
   0.85 were excluded from the association analysis. All quality control
   was performed with JMP genomics 6.0 software [[183]103].

Genome wide association analysis

   The analysis was performed using the “Genetics Q-K analysis workflow”
   of JMP-Genomics 6.0 software applying the mixed model K method
   [[184]105]. The genomic relationship matrix was calculated and included
   in the analysis as random effect, and the year of birth and SNP were
   included as fixed effects. Each marker was tested individually. An
   adjusted genome wide threshold of 0.6 × 10^− 6 was calculated by the R
   function “simpleM_Ex” [[185]106, [186]107] which applied the effective
   number of independent tests. The Benjamini-Hochberg p-value correction
   for multiple testing was calculated using the effective number of
   independent tests. If no SNP reached the genome wide threshold by
   trait, a secondary arbitrary threshold of 0.1 × 10^− 3 was used. The R
   package “CMplot” v3.3.0 [[187]108] was used to graph the p-value
   distributions.

Gene enrichment analysis

   A tissue restricted gene enrichment was performed for each GWA. The
   methodology described by Baranzini et al. [[188]109] was modified and
   carried out using in-house JAVA scripts. From each GWA, all SNPs with
   p-value ≤0.05 were included in the gene enrichment analysis and were
   defined as “raw” associated SNPs. Raw associated SNPs were assigned to
   genes if they were located inside a gene or within 3 kilobases upstream
   or downstream from a gene. Gene locations were obtain using Biomart
   from the Bos taurus UMD 3.1.1 assembly in Ensembl [[189]110, [190]111].
   The tissue restriction was performed by filtering genes expressed in
   bovine skeletal muscle, based on a list of 10,919 genes reported by the
   EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas (Additional file [191]12). The list included
   genes reported as expressed in at least one of the two types of
   experiments with codes E-MTAB-2798 and E-MTAB-2596. This list was also
   used as a background list in the tissue restricted gene enrichment
   analysis. The correlation between the raw associated SNPs within each
   gene was calculated based on their p-value, and SNPs were considered
   correlated when r^2 > ±0.3. A set of the most significant uncorrelated
   SNPs for each gene were retained for each gene. When all raw associated
   SNPs within a gene were correlated, the gene was included only once in
   the final gene list. Genes with more than one raw associated
   uncorrelated SNPs were included as many times as the number of
   uncorrelated SNPs in the final gene list to identify genes with
   possibly multiple functional polymorphisms. The maximum number of raw
   associated uncorrelated SNPs for one gene was three
   (Additional file [192]13).

   The available GO terms for molecular function, cellular component and
   biological process were included in the analysis using a GO term
   estimation for the background list in DAVID Bioinformatic Resources 6.8
   server [[193]112]. A total number of 105, 89, 85, 92, 81, 86, and 95 GO
   terms for WBSF, marbling, cooking loss, tenderness, juiciness,
   connective tissue, and flavor, respectively, were included
   (Additional file [194]14). Gene lists with 1714, 1636, 1632, 1753,
   1753, 1666, and 1684 genes for WBSF, marbling, cooking loss,
   tenderness, juiciness, connective tissue, and flavor, respectively,
   were used (Additional file [195]14). Gene enrichment was calculated
   using the hypergeometric test available in the Apache Commons
   Mathematics Library for JAVA [[196]113]. The Benjamini-Hochberg p-value
   correction was performed for each pathway by trait. The R package
   “limma” [[197]114] was used to visualize gene overlapping between
   traits if the same pathway was determined as enriched in numerous
   traits.

   A second analysis was performed using DAVID Bioinformatic Resources 6.8
   server [[198]112]. SNPs with p-value ≤0.05 from each GWA analysis were
   assigned to genes as described in the tissue restricted gene
   enrichment. All genes were included in the list only once
   (Additional file [199]14), regardless of how many uncorrelated
   associated SNP they contained. A total number of 2762, 2634, 2720,
   2788, 2840, 2685, and 2764 genes for WBSF, marbling, cooking loss,
   tenderness, juiciness, connective tissue, and flavor, respectively,
   were included in the gene list (Additional file [200]4). The default
   DAVID background list was used during the analysis.

Gene network and candidate genes with multiple QTLs

   All gene lists used in the tissue restricted gene enrichment analysis
   were included in the construction of a gene network represented by a
   matrix with traits as columns and genes as rows. The weight of each
   gene for each trait was determined by the number of raw associated
   uncorrelated SNPs. The R package “igraph” [[201]115] was used to
   construct the graphical representation of the top 30 most connected
   genes in the network.

   The top five genes in the gene network had a significantly higher
   connectivity than the rest of the genes in the network and were further
   analyzed as candidate genes with multiple QTLs associated with
   different meat quality traits. The LD pattern within each candidate
   genes with multiple QTLs was predicted using 196 families with 569
   steers from the present population. LD blocks were constructed using
   the Haploview software [[202]116] using a confidence interval of
   minimum 98% for strong LD [[203]117].

   An association analysis was performed for each one of the top five
   genes in order to confirm the presence of multiple QTLs. All the raw
   associated uncorrelated SNPs were fitted simultaneously in an
   association model. The analysis was performed using the “Genetics Q-K
   analysis workflow” of JMP-Genomics 6.0 software applying the mixed
   model K method [[204]105] and the final model included only significant
   SNPs associated with the phenotype that was being considered.

   To evaluate the potential effect of missense and synonymous variants
   identified in these five candidate genes, a bioinformatic analysis was
   performed. The foldRNA server was used to evaluate the MFE and mRNA
   structure parameters for each mRNA variant [[205]118]. The Prosite from
   expasy [[206]119], Phobius [[207]120], TMHMM [[208]121, [209]122], and
   SignalP 4.1 [[210]123] servers were used to predict domains,
   transmembrane regions and signal peptides in each protein,
   respectively. ComputePI from Expasy [[211]124] was used to calculate
   the isoelectic point of each protein variant.

Candidate structural protein assessment of proteolysis

   A protease substrate analysis for each of the structural proteins coded
   by genes identified in the previous analyses was performed. Genes
   identified through GWA analysis, either one of the gene enrichment
   procedures and the gene network analysis were included. Genes
   identified in at least two traits simultaneously for the tissue
   restricted gene enrichment and in at least three traits for the DAVID
   functional classification were analyzed. Only genes expressed in bovine
   muscle or adipose tissue (experiments with codes E-MTAB-2798 and
   E-MTAB-2596) based on the expression atlas [[212]125] were included in
   the analysis. This analysis was carried out using the PROSPER server
   [[213]126] which reports proteins that are possible substrates of
   μ-calpain.
