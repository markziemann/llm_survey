Based on the provided article, here is the information regarding the pathway enrichment analysis:

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - ToppFun was used for pathway enrichment analysis.

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**
   - No, the version number of ToppFun was not provided.

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**
   - Multiple databases were queried: Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database, and the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB).

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - Yes, a background gene set was described as containing all genes present in the datasets that were analyzed.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**
   - The article does not specify which statistical test was used for enrichment analysis; thus, it is noted as "not described."

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - Yes, a p-value cutoff of <0.05 with a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR threshold of 0.05 was applied, indicating that false discovery rate (FDR) correction was used.

Here is how this information can be tabulated:
