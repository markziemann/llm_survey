Abstract

Background

   Ruminants play a great role in sustainable livestock since they
   transform pastures, silage, and crop residues into high-quality human
   food (i.e. milk and beef). Animals with better ability to convert food
   into animal protein, measured as a trait called feed efficiency (FE),
   also produce less manure and greenhouse gas per kilogram of produced
   meat. Thus, the identification of high feed efficiency cattle is
   important for sustainable nutritional management. Our aim was to
   evaluate the potential of serum metabolites to identify FE of beef
   cattle before they enter the feedlot.

Results

   A total of 3598 and 4210 m/z features was detected in negative and
   positive ionization modes via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
   A single feature was different between high and low FE groups. Network
   analysis (WGCNA) yielded the detection of 19 and 20 network modules of
   highly correlated features in negative and positive mode respectively,
   and 1 module of each acquisition mode was associated with RFI
   (r = 0.55, P < 0.05). Pathway enrichment analysis (Mummichog) yielded
   the Retinol metabolism pathway associated with feed efficiency in beef
   cattle in our conditions.

Conclusion

   Altogether, these findings demonstrate the existence of a serum-based
   metabolomic signature associated with feed efficiency in beef cattle
   before they enter the feedlot. We are now working to validate the use
   of metabolites for identification of feed efficient animals for
   sustainable nutritional management.

Background

   The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates
   the world population will reach 9 billion people by 2050 and as a
   consequence, livestock production must double to meet the demand for
   food [[40]1]. Sustainable livestock production is a field of intense
   research where ruminants play a great role since they can transform
   graze pastures, silage and high-fiber crop residues into high-quality
   human food (i.e. milk and meat) [[41]2]. The goal is “sustainable
   intensification” [[42]3], meaning increased productivity while reducing
   the environmental impacts. In this context, feed efficiency (FE) has a
   particular importance, since it is directly related to productivity,
   greenhouse gas emission intensities, and resource use [[43]4, [44]5].

   Due to its importance, more than two dozen feed efficiency measurements
   have been proposed to select efficient animals and from those, residual
   feed intake (RFI) is considered one of the most effective methods
   [[45]6, [46]7]. As a complex trait, at least five major physiological
   mechanisms contribute to RFI variation: feed intake behavior,
   digestion, physical activity, thermoregulation and cell
   anabolism/catabolism [[47]8]. Recently, our group proposed a new
   biological process associated with FE in beef cattle: increased hepatic
   inflammation in less efficient animals probably caused by altered lipid
   metabolism and/or increased bacterial infection associated with higher
   feed intake [[48]9].

   Metabolomics is the systems-scale study of low-molecular-weight
   biochemicals (< 1500 Da) involved in metabolism, including
   carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, biogenic amines, and organic acids
   [[49]10, [50]11]. Due to the important role of metabolism across all
   biological processes, metabolomics studies have been increasingly used
   to understand physiological processes associated with economically
   important traits in livestock such as meat quality in pigs [[51]12],
   milk production in dairy cattle [[52]13–[53]15] and growth in beef
   cattle [[54]16]. Also, metabolomics has been applied to RFI studies,
   reporting blood metabolites in beef cattle during feedlot [[55]17,
   [56]18].

   Currently, there is an urgent need to develop new ways to predict FE in
   livestock, since the use of the commercially available genomic markers
   for genetic selection is not sensitive enough due to low to moderate
   heritability (ranging from 0.08 to 0.49) of the FE trait
   [[57]19–[58]22]. Therefore, we hypothesized there are specific serum
   metabolome signatures that predict feed efficiency in beef cattle
   before the feedlot which could be used for feed management of beef
   cattle. To this end, we used serum samples from a previous feeding
   trial with young Nellore bulls and performed a metabolomic approach on
   high and low feed efficient animals. The resulting data were used to
   investigate whether circulating metabolite levels could predict feed
   efficiency.

Methods

Phenotypic data collection

   All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
   and Use Committee of the Faculty of Food Engineering and Animal Science
   at the University of Sao Paulo (protocol 14.1.636.74.1). The serum of
   98 Nellore young bulls (16 to 20 months old and 376 ± 29 kg BW) born
   and raised in the University of Sao Paulo were collected 21 days prior
   to a 70-d feedlot. Briefly, the feeding-trial period was preceded by
   21 days of adaptation to diet and location and before that, the animals
   were maintained in a single group on Brachiaria spp. pastures. On
   adaptation period, animals received corn silage (ad libitum), gradually
   replaced by trial diet (total mixed ration, including dry corn grain,
   corn silage, soybean, citrus pulp pellets, urea, calcareous, mineral
   salt and potassium chloride) offered at 8:00 h and 16:00 h. After the
   experiment, all animals were slaughtered following the guidelines of
   the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. More details regarding
   animals, diet and experimental design can be found in Alexandre et al.
   [[59]9] and Mota et al. [[60]23].

   RFI was calculated as the difference between the expected and observed
   feed intake, considering the average metabolic weight (MBW) and ADG to
   predict DMI [[61]6]. The 98 animals were ranked by RFI, and two groups
   of 8 animals each were selected for further analysis (total of 16
   animals): high feed efficiency (HFE, low RFI) and low feed efficiency
   (LFE, high RFI). Sire and age effect on RFI were estimated by
   completely randomized design on linear model:
   [MATH: <mtext
   mathvariant="italic">Yijk</mtext><mo>=</mo><mi>μ</mi><mo>+</mo><mi
   mathvariant="italic">βi</mi><mo>+</mo><mi
   mathvariant="italic">βk</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="italic">eij</mi>
   :MATH]

   where Yij is the observation of jth individual, son of ith sire, with k
   age; μ is the general mean of the RFI; βi is the sire effect; βj is the
   age effect and eij is the random residual error, ~NID (0, σ^2[e]); and
   σ^2[e] is the residual variance. The phenotypic measures included:
   initial body weight (BWi), final body weight (BWF), dry matter intake
   (DMI), average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), residual
   feed intake (RFI), residual body weight gain (RWG), residual intake and
   body weight gain (RIG), initial ribeye area (REAi), final ribeye area
   (REAf) and gain of ribeye area (REAg). Normality of data was tested by
   the Shapiro-Wilk test. Student’s t-test was applied to compare the
   groups for normally distributed variables and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon
   test for nonparametric variables using R STATS package. Results were
   considered significant when p-value (P) ≤ 0.05. The RFI values were
   adjusted using regression model, in which the age was fitted as a
   covariate for network analysis (Additional file [62]1).

Sample collection

   Serum samples were collected 21 days before the start of the feeding
   trial (before the adaptation period) by jugular venipuncture using
   vacutainer tubes. After 30 min at room temperature for clot formation,
   all samples were centrifuged at 3500×g for 15 min at 4 °C and stored at
   − 80 °C until further analysis, following the recommendations of Tuck
   et al. [[63]24].

LC-MS analysis

   Protein precipitation of serum samples was performed at 4 °C by adding
   methanol (1:4 serum: methanol) and vortexing for 120 s at 5000 rpm
   [[64]10]. The samples were then centrifuged at 16000 g for 4 min at
   room temperature, and the supernatants were dried in a vacuum
   centrifugal evaporator for 3 h at 30 °C and stored at − 20 °C prior to
   analysis. The samples were reconstituted in 200 μL H[2]O and
   centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatants were transferred
   to analytical vials for analysis using a Xevo G2 XS
   quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF-MS) in positive and
   negative modes (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). Chromatographic
   separation was performed by an Acquity I-Class UPLC system (Waters
   Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) using a Waters Acquity BEH C18 column
   (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm) (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) at
   50 °C. The injected sample volume was 5 μL. The mobile phase consisted
   of 0.1% formic acid-water (eluent A) and 0.1% formic acid-methanol
   (eluent B). The gradient elution in positive mode was performed at a
   flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, as follows: between 0 and 1 min 0% eluent B;
   1–16 min increasing up to 100% eluent B;16–20 min at 100% eluent B and
   20–22 min decreasing back to 0% eluent B. The elution flow rate was
   0.36 ml/min in negative mode, with an elution gradient as follows:
   0–2 min 0% eluent B; 2–17 min increasing up to 100% eluent B; 17–22 min
   at 100% eluent B and 22–24 min decreasing back to 0% eluent B.

   The UPLC was connected to the electrospray ionization (ESI) interface,
   operating in negative and positive modes, with a capillary voltage of
   − 2.5/+ 3 KV, source temperature of 150 °C, cone gas flow of 50 L/h,
   cone voltage of 40 V, desolvation temperature of 550 °C and desolvation
   gas flow of 800 L/h. The spectra were collected at high resolution
   (mass resolving power 30,000 M/ΔM at fwhm) from 100 m/z (mass/charge
   ratio) to 1200 m/z, collected over 250 ms per spectrum in centroid
   mode. To avoid problems due to instrument drift, the sequence of
   samples was randomized and pooled quality-control samples (QC) were
   injected periodically for use in downstream data processing and
   correction [[65]10]. QC samples were prepared by pooling equal volumes
   of all samples; these samples were run after every four sample
   injections to provide a measurement of the stability and performance of
   the system.

Data treatment and pre-processing

   LC-MS raw data were created and processed and using Waters MassLynx™
   (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) Software v4.1 and Progenesis QI
   (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK). Following the manufacturer’s
   instructions, a reference run was automatically selected, and the
   precursor ion traces were processed for alignment, peak picking and
   normalization with default parameters. Locally estimated scatterplot
   smoothing (LOESS) signal correction based on QC samples was performed
   using MATLAB 2016 software with a script built for this purpose
   [[66]25].

   Afterward, a quality assurance (QA) step was used for analytical
   validation: variables with unacceptable reproducibility in QC samples
   (RSD > 20% in QCs or detected in less than 50% of QCs) and samples
   (detected in less than 90% of QC) were removed from the dataset
   [[67]10]. The confidence scores of annotated metabolites are 2, meaning
   they have matches to a search database [[68]26].

Metabolomics data analysis

   Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out using
   Metaboanalyst 4.0 Web Server [[69]27]. Glog transformation [[70]28] and
   auto-scaling [[71]29] were applied. Differences between the groups were
   investigated using univariate (UA) and multivariate analysis (MA). For
   MA, principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-square
   discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used for detection of outliers and
   to identify features potentially responsible for variation between the
   groups [[72]29]. PLS-DA model quality was assessed using the goodness
   of fit (R^2) and goodness of prediction (Q^2) in cross-validation and
   using a permutation test with 2000 permutations [[73]29]. For UA,
   t-test was used to identify differentially expressed features, then the
   p-values were corrected for multiple tests by Significance Analysis of
   Microarrays (SAM-FDR) method [[74]30]. Features with SAM-FDR
   q-value < 0.05 were considered different between groups.

Network analysis

   Network and clustering analysis were performed using the Weighted Gene
   Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) R package [[75]31, [76]32].
   Normalized data from positive and negative acquisition modes were used
   separately as described by Fukushima et al. [[77]33], with a soft
   threshold of 3, chosen using a scale-free topology criterion
   (R^2 = 0.9). Modules containing at least 20 features were retained.

   To select modules associated with FE, Pearson correlations between each
   module’s “eigengene” and the RFI were calculated. The “eigengene” is
   the first principal component of a given module and a representative
   measure of its metabolic profile. (The term “gene” is used even for
   other data types, due to the development of WGCNA originally for the
   analysis of transcriptional data.) Modules with a module-trait
   relationship magnitude (correlation) > 0.5 for RFI (P ≤ 0.05) were
   considered significant. Individual features were considered for further
   analysis only if they had module membership (MM) > 0.6 (P < 0.01) and
   gene significance (GS) > 0.5 (P < 0.05). GS is defined as the
   association of features with RFI, and MM is defined as the correlation
   of the features with the module eigengene. High GS and MM scores
   indicate a feature is a central element of a module and is
   significantly associated with the trait [[78]34].

Metabolic pathway analysis

   Metabolic pathway analysis was performed using Mummichog software 1.0.9
   with Bos taurus species (KEGG database) as reference [[79]35]. Using
   default parameters for analyte prediction (mass accuracy 10 ppm) and
   for pathway enrichment analysis (1000 permutations). Features from UA
   with P < 0.01 were used as input to mummichog to test for pathway
   enrichment compared to random data resampled from the reference list,
   yielding an empirical p-value per pathway. Pathways with corrected
   q-value < 0.05 were considered significant.

Results

   We performed a 70-day feeding trial on 98 Nellore young bulls to
   evaluate their feed efficiency [[80]9]. Based on the linear model (see
   Methods), there was no significant sire effect on RFI and the high feed
   efficient (HFE) and the low feed efficient (LFE) groups were
   statistically different (P ≤ 0.05) for all FE traits (feed conversion
   ratio (FCR), RFI, residual weight gain (RWG) and residual intake and
   weight gain (RIG), dry matter intake (DMI)) and also for average daily
   gain (ADG). There was also a significant difference for backfat
   thickness at the end of the experiment (BFTf, P ≤ 0.05), which were
   greater in the LFE group (Table [81]1). Therefore, HFE animals in this
   experiment are more sustainable since they eat less, are leaner and
   have a better ADG than LFE animals.

Metabolome profile and differential analysis

   After quality assurance processing, a total of 3598 and 4210 m/z in
   negative and positive ionization modes, respectively, were used for
   parallel analyses. For Principal component analysis (PCA), no
   separation was observed for high and low FE animals in the first five
   principal components (Fig. [83]1), which explained 64.5 and 57% of
   total variance for negative and positive modes, respectively. PLS-DA
   was able to distinguish the two groups, but permutation and
   cross-validation analyses indicated the model was overfitted and thus
   not predictive (Fig. [84]1). The univariate analysis yielded one
   feature with different abundance between groups in positive mode. The
   spectra of mass-charge 183.1670 m/z and retention time v4.00 min on
   chromatography column (Fig. [85]2) has a P < 0.001 (SAM-FDR = 0.03)
   which is greater on HFE group. No significantly different m/z were
   identified in negative mode.

   metabolomics data: R^2 > 0.8 and Q^2 > 0.5, the model was not
   overfitted. Consistent with this, a permutation test (2000
   permutations) yielded P-values > 0.9 in both modes

Pathway enrichment analysis

   Pathway enrichment analysis was performed to explore possible pathways
   involved in RFI phenotypic variation prior to the feedlot. Mummichog
   software identified the enrichment of retinol metabolic pathway
   (P < 0.05; Table [90]2), as being associated with FE in positive mode
   with 2 pathway metabolites annotated in the data. The putative
   compounds hit included retinoate ([91]C00777) and, either the isobaric
   compounds (molecular weight 284.4357): all-trans-Retinal ([92]C00376)
   or 11-cis-Retinal ([93]C02110) (Table [94]3).

Weighted correlation network analysis

   We then used WGCNA co-expression analysis to identify clusters of
   analytes that may have a relationship with the feed efficiency. WGCNA
   identified 19 and 20 modules of highly correlated features in negative
   and positive mode, respectively.

   One of these modules was significantly positively correlated with RFI
   (blue module from the negative mode, r = 0.55, and P = 0.033),
   indicating higher levels in LFE animals. The blue module contains 196
   features (Fig. [97]3a), of which 65 were identified as important
   contributors to this module (Additional file [98]2). Using mummichog,
   three of these features were putatively annotated: (i) 6S,9R-Vomifoliol
   (compound KEGG [99]C01760) (ii) 2,3, Dihydroflavone (compound
   [100]C00766); (iii) Limonoate (compound [101]C01593). The additional
   file [102]2 has information of the important features of blue module on
   negative mode, including mass-charge (m/z), retention time (rt),
   feature significance to trait (GS), feature significance to module
   (FM), group with highest abundance, putative matched compound in KEGG
   and mass difference between feature and putative compound.

   A second module was associated with RFI (blue module from the positive

   LFE animals. This module contains 112 features (Fig. [105]3b), of which
   39 were identified as highly important contributors to this module
   (Additional file [106]3). Using mummichog, 5 compounds were annotated:
   (i) Phytanic acid (compound [107]C01607); (ii) all-trans-Retinal
   (compound [108]C00376); (iii) Progesterone (compound [109]C00410); (iv)

Discussion

   Brazilian cattle are mainly raised in pastures, but can also be kept in
   feedlot systems with diets composed of silage or other feedstuffs, such
   as high-fiber crop residues or grains (corn and soybean), to improve
   body weight gain before slaughter. We used serum samples collected
   before the feedlot period to search for a potential early metabolomic
   signature for FE, with the intent to support nutritional management
   decisions to improve productivity and sustainability of livestock.
   Thus, we performed an exploratory analysis using untargeted
   metabolomics coupled with bioinformatics and interpretation tools
   including Mummichog and WGCNA. We found one differentially expressed
   feature between HFE and LFE animals in these conditions, but most
   importantly, we also found one enriched pathway and two sets of highly
   correlated features significantly associated with FE, which could be
   considered a potential molecular signature of FE in Nellore cattle
   before they enter the feedlot period.

   A co-expression module associated with a phenotype provides significant
   promise for the development of a molecular signature, clearly more than
   a single statistically different feature between two conditions
   [[113]36]. In our previous work, the co-expression gene modules and
   their gene ontology were far more important results than the
   differentially expressed genes [[114]9]. In this context, the hepatic
   inflammatory response was associated with feed efficiency in cattle.
   Here, the WGCNA analysis indicated two modules of co-expressed features
   positively associated with RFI, with equal correlation, p-values (Fig.
   [115]3) and common features, suggesting that both networks belong to
   the same molecular signature.

   We were able to identify 7 molecules from the co-expressed modules
   through Mummichog prediction: Retinal, Progesterone, Stearic acid,
   Vomifoliol, 2,3 Dihydroflavone, Limonoate and Phytanic acid.
   Interestingly, all these molecules have higher levels in LFE animals
   which are in accordance with the modules being positively associated
   with RFI. In addition, mummichog software predicted two molecules from
   the retinol pathway significantly associated with FE: a higher level of
   Retinal and lower level of Retinoate ([116]C00777) in LFE, which
   implies the enzymes aldehyde oxidase and retinal dehydrogenase (that
   convert Retinal to Retinoate) as probably less active/expressed in LFE
   animals. This result is in accordance with Zhao and colleagues
   [[117]37] who demonstrate vitamin A (VA) metabolism is important for
   feed efficiency in pigs as key genes of VA metabolism such as ALDH1A2
   and CYP1A1 are upregulated in the liver of HFE animals. Also, in two
   transcriptome studies, the retinol pathway was upregulated in the liver
   of high-RFI Jersey steers [[118]38] and over-represented in the small
   intestine from high intake beef steers [[119]39]. A GWAS-study using
   CNV markers evidenced the RDH5 (an important gene of the retinol
   metabolism pathway) as a candidate gene associated with feed conversion
   rate in Nellore cattle [[120]40]. Therefore, our results agreed with
   the literature regarding the importance of the retinol metabolism
   pathway for feed efficiency in livestock animals.

   Progesterone (P4) was another feature predicted in the molecular
   signature of FE being more present in the blood of LFE animals. Steroid
   hormone biosynthesis was overrepresented in the set of genes in the
   liver that were upregulated in the high-RFI (low FE) group of Jersey
   cows [[121]38], which is in accordance with our results. Recently, P4
   signaling in broiler skeletal muscle was associated with divergent feed
   efficiency [[122]41]. So far, there is no consensus on the role of P4
   on feed efficiency in livestock and further studies should be
   performed.

   The stearic acid is a saturated acid (C18:0) and one of the end
   products of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in animals. This fatty
   acid was found increased in plasma of steers with least ADG in
   comparison with greatest ADG [[123]42], and this result corroborates
   our finding of a higher level of stearic acid in the molecular
   signature associated with LFE animals since they had less ADG than HFE
   in our experiment.

   From all predicted molecules, Vomifoliol, 2,3 Dihydroflavone, Limonoate
   and Phytanic acid are molecules produced exclusively by bacteria or
   plants and not mammals. The higher presence of these molecules in the
   blood of LFE animals could be due to higher DMI of these animals in
   comparison with HFE animals, allowing the higher presence of these
   metabolites in the blood. However, this possibility lacks further
   evidence since we did not evaluate the pasture DMI of these animals,
   i.e. feed intake before they arrive at the feedlot. From these 4
   molecules, the Phytanic Acid could have a role on feed efficiency.
   Phytanic acid is a branched-chain fatty acid formed during the
   metabolism of phytol [[124]43] by ruminal bacteria and is a known
   agonist for the nuclear-receptor-retinoid-X-receptor [[125]44] and the
   peroxisome proliferated-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) [[126]45]. These
   two proteins are important nuclear receptors regulating the expression
   of several genes in response to environmental factors (i.e. diet) and
   endogenous molecules. Interestingly, in rats, agonists of PPAR-α
   decreased feed efficiency [[127]46], and the PPAR signalling pathway
   was enriched in the small intestine transcriptome analysis of high vs.
   low feed intake cattle [[128]39]. Therefore, agonists of PPAR-α could
   reasonably be associated with feed efficiency in cattle, but new
   evidence should be provided to confirm this hypothesis.

   Our integrated approach using data annotation, mummichog prediction and
   WGCNA co-expression analyses indicated a molecular signature enriched
   for biological processes previously associated with FE. The metabolites
   in WGCNA modules were also predicted by mummichog, which supports the
   validity of the in silico network analysis since the two different
   analyses yielded consistent results. Therefore, we believe metabolomics
   based modules associated with FE possibly represent a molecular
   metabolic signature of FE. Although we have not yet been able to
   identify the majority of the features in those modules, previous
   studies on feed efficiency support the network analysis results.
   Moreover, we noted it is possible to have a molecular signature
   associated with a phenotype without knowing the function of the
   components, just by (for metabolites) tracking m/z ratio and retention
   time in a standardized assay. As an example, this is the case for
   commercially available genomic selection in dairy cattle using DNA
   markers, where the majority of the markers are not functional SNPs.

   In our data, we found only one feature statistically different between
   the FE groups: the feature with m/z 183.1670 and RT of 4.00 min
   (positive mode) is upregulated in HFE animals. This result along with
   the co-expressed module provides evidence of early serum metabolome
   differences between high and low FE animals. Between both the positive
   and negative ionization modes and after quality control-based
   filtering, the serum metabolome of the animals in this experiment
   consisted of approximately 8000 features. One may expect a priori to
   identify more than just one different feature between high and low FE
   animals using such a powerful tool. Possible explanations for this
   result include, but are not limited to: (1) although the groups are
   very distinct phenotypically at the end of the experiment, their
   baseline metabolic profiles may have been more similar at the time when
   samples were collected (21 days before the beginning of the feeding
   trial) [[129]9]; (2) the FE was estimated for feedlot performance and
   not for pasture grazing; at the time of sampling all animals were still
   on pasture conditions, which may yield more similar metabolic
   phenotypes than a high grain diet; (3) the animals were clinically
   healthy over the whole experiment. Thus, no major physiological disturb
   could lead to large metabolome difference between the FE groups; (4)
   the number of sampled animals (8 animals per group) could limit the
   statistical power [[130]47] for these outbred, genetically different
   animals that may have high baseline diversity in metabolic profiles. To
   address this last issue, one of our ongoing projects is to validate
   these results in a cohort with more animals, to develop a future
   technology help establish a framework for future for FE prediction.

Conclusion

   The conclusion from this work is the detection of a molecular signature
   for feed efficiency of beef cattle based on untargeted metabolomics.
   This molecular signature indicated the vitamin A metabolism pathway as
   one of the important pathways for this phenotype.
