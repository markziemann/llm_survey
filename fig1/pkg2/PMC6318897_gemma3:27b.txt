Here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis methods used in the provided scientific article, formatted for a table:

**1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**

*   KOBAS software & Blast2GO software & WEGO software

**2. Was a tool version number provided?**

*   Blast2GO software: not described
*   WEGO software: not described
*   KOBAS software: not described

**3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**

*   GO (Gene Ontology)
*   KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)

**4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**

*   Yes, the assembled reference transcriptome was used as the background gene list.

**5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**

*   Not explicitly stated, but p-values were calculated for enrichment and used to identify significant pathways.

**6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**

*   Yes, Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach was used to adjust p-values and control false discovery rate (FDR). p-value < 0.05 was used as the threshold.
