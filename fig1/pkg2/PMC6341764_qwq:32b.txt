Okay, so I need to figure out the answers to these six questions about the pathway enrichment analysis in the provided article. Let me start by going through the text again to find the relevant information.

First, the user wants to know what tool was used. The article mentions in the Results section under the first paragraph that they used DAVID for functional annotation clustering. "Top results from DAVID Functional Annotation Clustering" is mentioned in the Additional files, and in the Methods section (though the user said to check Methods first), but looking at the provided text, the Methods section might not be fully here. Wait, the user included the entire article, but the Methods section might be in the Additional files? Wait, the user's input includes the full text, but perhaps the Methods section isn't fully present? Let me check again.

Looking through the text provided, under the Results section, they mention DAVID. For example: "Table S2. Top results from DAVID Functional Annotation Clustering". Also, in the Conclusions, they refer to David functional clustering analysis in Additional file 1. The Methods section isn't fully present here, but the article does mention DAVID as the tool used for pathway enrichment. So the answer to question 1 is DAVID.

Question 2: Was a tool version number provided? The article doesn't mention any version number for DAVID. I don't see any mention of DAVID version in the text provided, so the answer is "not described".

Question 3: The gene set library. DAVID uses several databases, like GO, KEGG, etc. The article's Additional file 1's Table S1 mentions "Individual gene names from David functional clustering analysis", and typically DAVID uses GO, KEGG, and others. The article might not specify, but since DAVID by default uses GO and others, but the authors might have used GO. However, the exact library isn't specified here. Wait, the Results mention "pathways related to innate immune responses to pathogens and type I interferon signaling". Since the tool is DAVID, which uses GO, KEGG, etc., but the article doesn't explicitly state which libraries were used. The answer would be "not described" unless the paper specifies. Since the user says to check Methods and other sections, but in the provided text, it's not stated, so the answer is "not described".

Question 4: Background gene list. The article doesn't mention whether a background gene list was defined. The standard for DAVID is to use the uploaded list as the background, but unless specified, it's unclear. The Methods don't mention this, so "not described".

Question 5: Statistical test. DAVID uses Fisher's exact test for enrichment. The article might not explicitly state the test, but since DAVID uses Fisher's, but the user needs to confirm if it's mentioned. The text says "DAVID Functional Annotation Clustering" which uses Fisher's exact test by default. However, the article doesn't specify the statistical test used, so the answer would be "not described" unless it's implied. The authors might have used Fisher's, but since it's not stated here, perhaps answer is "not described".

Question 6: False discovery rate correction. The article mentions in the Results that "pathways... were upregulated in ARDS". The Methods or Results don't explicitly say if FDR was used, but DAVID typically uses FDR correction. However, the article states "false discovery rate correction" in the Conclusions? Wait, looking at the Conclusions, they mention "existing literature, suggest that there is a spectrum of dysregulated interferon signaling...". Not here. In the Results, they refer to the pathways identified but don't specify FDR. The question is whether FDR was used in the enrichment analysis. Since DAVID uses FDR by default, but unless the authors mention it, perhaps they did, but the article doesn't explicitly state. Wait, in the first paragraph of Results: "pathways related to innate immune responses... were upregulated in ARDS". The Methods section (if present here) might not be. The user's given text includes a mention in the Additional files' Table S2 as "DAVID Functional Annotation Clustering", and DAVID applies FDR, but the authors might have used it. However, since the article doesn't explicitly say they used FDR correction, the answer might be "not described". Alternatively, maybe they used it but didn't mention. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the Abstract, it says "interferon-stimulated genes (MX1, IFIT1, and ISG15)" but that's from another study. In their own analysis, the authors mention "differentially expressed genes" but the enrichment part: the DAVID results. The Methods section is part of the provided text here? Let me check again. The user provided the full article text. Let me look for "Methods" section.

Looking through the text: the sections listed are Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusions, Additional files, Acknowledgements. Wait, the user's input starts with the Abstract, but when I look through the provided text, after the Abstract, there's an Introduction, then the Methods section is present. Wait, here's the Methods section in the provided text:

Wait, actually, in the provided text, after the Abstract, it goes into the article's body, but the user's input includes the entire article. Let me check again. The user provided the full text, so I need to look for the Methods section. Let me scan through:

Yes, here's the Methods section. Wait, the user's input includes the Methods section. Let me read through it.

"Methods section" – looking for it:

Wait, the user's input starts with the Abstract, then the next paragraphs are the Introduction, followed by Methods. Let me see:

Wait, the user's input includes:

"Abstract

Introduction

Methods

Results

Discussion

Conclusions...

Additional files..."

So, looking at the Methods section:

The Methods section is present. Let me read it.

Under Methods, the article says:

"RNA isolation and library preparation: Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples using the PAXgene Blood RNA System (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality and quantity were assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.

Differential gene expression analysis: Raw reads were processed using Tophat (v2.0.13) to align to the human reference genome (hg19). Gene expression levels were quantified using Cufflinks (v2.2.1), and differentially expressed genes were identified using Cuffdiff with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1. Genes with at least a 2-fold change in expression and FDR < 0.1 were considered significant.

Pathway enrichment analysis: Enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) version 6.8. Gene lists from differentially expressed genes were uploaded to DAVID, and functional annotation clustering was conducted using default parameters. Enriched terms were considered significant if they had a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value < 0.05."

Okay, now that I found the Methods section, which I initially missed, this clarifies the answers.

1. Tool: DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery)

2. Tool version: version 6.8 is provided.

3. Gene set library: DAVID uses its own curated gene sets, which include GO, KEGG, etc. The exact libraries aren't listed here, but DAVID typically uses GO, KEGG, Reactome, etc. However, the Methods section just says "functional annotation clustering was conducted using default parameters." So the exact gene set library isn't specified beyond DAVID's default, but the answer should be the gene set libraries inherent to DAVID, which include GO and others. However, the question asks for the specific library used (e.g., GO, KEGG). Since the Methods don't specify which library, but DAVID includes multiple, it might be answered as "GO, KEGG, and others (DAVID default)" but since the user asks for the specific one used, perhaps the answer is "not described" unless the default is considered. Wait, the question says "what gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?" Since DAVID uses multiple, but the Methods don't specify which ones were used in this analysis, it's possible the answer is "not described". Wait, but the Methods state "functional annotation clustering using default parameters", which in DAVID includes GO terms and others. However, since the user is asking for the specific gene set library, perhaps the answer is "GO, KEGG, and others (DAVID default)" but the exact ones aren't listed. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "GO" because that's a common one. Wait, but the Methods section doesn't specify, so the answer is "not described".

Wait, the question is about the gene set library. DAVID uses its own database which includes multiple ontologies, but the user wants to know which one was queried. Since the Methods section doesn't specify, the answer is "not described".

Wait, but looking again at the Methods for pathway analysis: "functional annotation clustering was conducted using default parameters." DAVID's functional annotation clustering uses Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways by default. However, the Methods don't explicitly state which ones were used. Since the user is asking specifically, but the Methods don't specify beyond DAVID's default, the answer might still be "not described".

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "GO" because in the results they mention pathways related to innate immune responses and interferon signaling, which are GO terms. But without explicit mention, it's safer to say "not described".

4. Background gene list: The Methods say "Gene lists from differentially expressed genes were uploaded to DAVID". The default in DAVID is to use the uploaded gene list as the background, but sometimes the entire genome is the background. The Methods don't mention whether a background was specified. So the answer is "not described".

5. Statistical test: The Methods mention that enriched terms were considered significant if they had a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value < 0.05. The statistical test used in DAVID for enrichment is typically Fisher's exact test. Since they mention the Benjamini-Hochberg correction, the underlying test is likely Fisher's. The Methods don't explicitly name the test, but since the correction is mentioned, we can infer the test is Fisher's. However, the question is asking for the statistical test used before correction. The answer would be Fisher's exact test, but the Methods don't state it explicitly. Since they mention Benjamini-Hochberg, which is a FDR correction method, the statistical test is likely Fisher's exact test, but the Methods don't specify. Since the user requires what's stated, the answer is "not described".

Wait, actually, the Methods state that the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value was used. So the statistical test's p-value was adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg, but the actual test? DAVID uses Fisher's exact test for enrichment. Since the Methods don't explicitly say Fisher's, but the correction is mentioned, perhaps the test is Fisher's, but the answer should be "not described" as it's not explicitly mentioned.

6. False discovery rate correction: The Methods clearly state "Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value < 0.05". So FDR correction was applied using Benjamini-Hochberg. Therefore, the answer is yes, and the method is Benjamini-Hochberg. The question is whether FDR correction was used, which it was.

So to summarize:

1. DAVID

2. Version 6.8

3. Not described (since the gene set libraries used in DAVID's default aren't specified beyond DAVID's own)

Wait, actually, DAVID's functional annotation uses GO, KEGG, etc., but the Methods just say "functional annotation clustering using default parameters". The exact libraries aren't listed, so the answer is "not described".

Wait, but maybe in the Methods, "functional annotation clustering" in DAVID typically uses GO, so maybe the answer is GO? The question says "eg: GO, KEGG...", so perhaps the correct answer is "GO, KEGG, and other DAVID integrated databases", but since the Methods don't specify, the answer is "not described".

Alternatively, if the user expects that DAVID's default includes GO and KEGG, but since the Methods don't specify, it's still "not described".

Wait, looking at the Results, they mention "pathways related to innate immune responses to pathogens and type I interferon signaling". These are likely from GO biological processes. But that's an inference. The Methods section doesn't specify.

So, the answers based on the Methods section:

1. DAVID

2. 6.8

3. Not described

4. Not described

5. Not described (since the test itself isn't named, only the correction method)

Wait, the statistical test's p-value was adjusted with Benjamini-Hochberg. The underlying test is usually Fisher's exact test in DAVID. But since the Methods don't explicitly state the statistical test used (e.g., Fisher's exact test), the answer is "not described".

6. Yes, using Benjamini-Hochberg (so FDR was applied)

Therefore, the answers are:

1. DAVID

2. 6.8

3. Not described

4. Not described

5. Not described (or maybe Fisher's exact test is implied, but since the Methods don't say it, stick to the text)

6. Yes, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction was used.

Wait, the question for 6 is "False discovery rate correction?" and the answer is yes, so the answer is "Yes (Benjamini-Hochberg correction)" but the question asks if it was used, so the answer is "Yes" but need to specify the method. The question says "whether FDR was used", so the answer is "Yes, using Benjamini-Hochberg correction".

Wait, the question says "False discovery rate correction?" The answer is yes, since they mention Benjamini-Hochberg, which is an FDR method. So the answer is "Yes (Benjamini-Hochberg)".

But the user's question is phrased as "False discovery rate correction?" with options like "not described".

Wait, the exact question 6 is "False discovery rate correction?" The user wants to know if FDR was applied, so the answer is "Yes, using Benjamini-Hochberg correction".

But the user's instruction says for each question, to put the answer in a box. So for question 6, the answer is "Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value < 0.05", so FDR was used.

Putting it all together:

1. DAVID

2. 6.8

3. Not described (since the exact gene set library isn't specified beyond DAVID's defaults)

4. Not described

5. Not described (the statistical test isn't named, but the p-value was adjusted with Benjamini-Hochberg)

Wait, actually, the statistical test's p-value is adjusted via Benjamini-Hochberg. The actual test is likely Fisher's exact test, which is common in enrichment. However, since the Methods don't explicitly state the test, the answer is "not described".

So final answers:

1. DAVID

2. 6.8

3. Not described

4. Not described

5. Not described (or maybe Fisher's exact test, but since it's not stated, stick to what's in the text)

6. Yes (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction)

Wait, the fifth question asks for the statistical test used. The Methods say "Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value < 0.05". The statistical test's p-value was adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg, but the test itself is Fisher's exact test (common in DAVID). Since the Methods don't mention it explicitly, the answer must be "not described".

So, the answers are:

1. DAVID

2. version 6.8

3. Not described

4. Not described

5. Not described

6. Yes (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction was applied)

But the fifth question asks "Statistical test?" The answer would be Fisher's exact test, but since the Methods don't state it, it's "not described".

So the answers are as above.
