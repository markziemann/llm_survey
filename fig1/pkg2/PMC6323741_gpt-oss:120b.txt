Thinking...
We need to answer 6 questions about pathway enrichment analysis. Need to extract explicitly reported details from article.

Search article: Methods section contains "Pathway enrichment analysis". Let's locate.

From article text: 

"Pathway enrichment analysis

   Pathway enrichment analysis was performed to explore possible pathways
   involved in RFI phenotypic variation prior to the feedlot. Mummichog
   software identified the enrichment of retinol metabolic pathway
   (P < 0.05; Table [90]2), as being associated with FE in positive mode
   with 2 pathway metabolites annotated in the data. The putative
   compounds hit included retinoate ([91]C00777) and, either the isobaric
   compounds (molecular weight 284.4357): all-trans-Retinal ([92]C00376)
   or 11-cis-Retinal ([93]C02110) (Table [94]3)."

Method section earlier: "Pathway enrichment analysis" sub-section:

"Pathway enrichment analysis

   Pathway enrichment analysis was performed to explore possible pathways
   involved in RFI phenotypic variation prior to the feedlot. Mummichog
   software identified the enrichment of retinol metabolic pathway
   (P < 0.05; Table [90]2), as being associated with FE in positive mode
   with 2 pathway metabolites annotated in the data."

Also earlier: Under Methods: "Pathway enrichment analysis" sub-section: "Mummichog software identified the enrichment of retinol metabolic pathway..."

Need to check if any other tools are mentioned. In Methods, they say: "Pathway enrichment analysis was performed ... Mummichog software ...". Let's locate exact phrasing.

From Methods: 

"Pathway enrichment analysis

   Pathway enrichment analysis was performed to explore possible pathways
   involved in RFI phenotypic variation prior to the feedlot. Mummichog
   software identified the enrichment of retinol metabolic pathway
   (P < 0.05; Table [90]2), as being associated with FE in positive mode
   with 2 pathway metabolites annotated in the data."

But we need exact text: "Mummichog software" maybe with version? Not described.

Also "KEGG" appears for pathway database. They mention "the retinol metabolic pathway". In Table 2: "Pathway size", "Total Hits", "Significant Hits", "Fisher’s P value". So they used Fisher's exact test (Fisher’s P value). That's a statistical test.

Did they mention multiple testing correction? In Results they mention "Pathway enrichment analysis was performed... Mummichog software identified the enrichment of retinol metabolic pathway (P < 0.05; Table 2)". No mention of FDR correction for enrichment. So answer "No" for multiple testing correction applied.

Custom background gene list? Not described. They used metabolites not genes. But we must answer: "Does the article describe using a custom or specific background gene list for enrichment analysis?" The article does not mention background list. So "Not described".

Gene set libraries used: They used KEGG pathways (Retinol metabolism). So "KEGG". Possibly also "Mummichog uses KEGG database". In methods: "Mummichog software". They might also mention "KEGG". In the text: "Mummichog software identified the enrichment of retinol metabolic pathway". The pathway is from KEGG. They also refer to "Compound KEGG". So library is KEGG.

Now compile answers.

Tool used: Mummichog.

Version: Not described.

Gene set libraries: KEGG (specifically retinol metabolism). Any other? Not described.

Custom background: Not described.

Statistical test: Fisher's exact test (they say "Fisher’s P value" in Table 2). So answer: Fisher's exact test.

Multiple testing correction: Not described (they didn't mention FDR for enrichment). So "No".

Now produce table format with columns for each question? The prompt: "Please answer the following 6 questions. ... Be terse and provide output in table format."

We need a table with rows per question and answer. Could also list multiple tools. Let's produce.

Columns: Question, Answer.

Let's fill.

1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? => Mummichog

2. Were enrichment tool version(s) described? => Not described

3. Which gene set libraries were used? => KEGG

4. Does the article describe using a custom or specific background gene list for enrichment analysis? => Not described

5. What statistical test(s) were used in enrichment analysis? => Fisher's exact test

6. Was multiple testing correction / FDR applied to enrichment analysis? => No (since not mentioned) Actually answer "No" if not explicitly mentioned. So "No".

Now produce table.
...done thinking.
