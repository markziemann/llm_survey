Abstract

   In the current study we compared the molecular signature of expanded
   mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) derived from selected CD271+ bone
   marrow mononuclear cells (CD271-MSCs) and MSCs derived from
   non-selected bone marrow mononuclear cells by plastic adherence
   (PA-MSCs). Transcriptome analysis demonstrated for the first time the
   upregulation of 115 and downregulation of 131 genes in CD271-MSCs.
   Functional enrichment analysis showed that the upregulated genes in
   CD271-MSCs are significantly enriched for extracellular matrix
   (tenascin XB, elastin, ABI family, member 3 (NESH) binding protein,
   carboxypeptidase Z, laminin alpha 2 and nephroblastoma overexpressed)
   and cell adhesion (CXCR7, GPNMB, MYBPH, SVEP1, ARHGAP6, TSPEAR, PIK3CG,
   ABL2 and NCAM1). CD271-MSCs expressed higher gene transcript levels
   that are involved in early osteogenesis/chondrogenesis/adipogenesis
   (ZNF145, FKBP5). In addition, increased transcript levels for early and
   late osteogenesis (DPT, OMD, ID4, CRYAB, SORT1), adipogenesis (CTNNB1,
   ZEB, LPL, FABP4, PDK4, ACDC), and chondrogenesis (CCN3/NOV, CCN4/WISP1,
   CCN5/WISP2 and ADAMTS-5) were detected. Interestingly, CD271-MSCs
   expressed increased levels of hematopoiesis associated genes (CXCL12,
   FLT3L, IL-3, TPO, KITL). Down-regulated genes in CD271-MSCs were
   associated with WNT and TGF-beta signaling, and cytokine/chemokine
   signaling pathways. In addition to their capacity to support
   hematopoiesis, these results suggest that CD271-MSCs may contain more
   osteo/chondro progenitors and/or feature a greater differentiation
   potential.

Introduction

   Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent non-hematopoietic
   cells that can be derived from bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs),
   adipose tissue or other tissues^[41]1,[42]2. They represent a very
   heterogeneous population with regard to phenotype, i.e. surface marker
   profile, and function such as proliferative and differentiation
   potential^[43]3,[44]4. The marker CD271, also known as low affinity
   nerve growth factor receptor (LNGFR) or p75NTR, was reported to
   potentially define precursor cells which give rise to a more
   homogeneous MSC subpopulation (CD271-MSCs)^[45]5,[46]6. However,
   studies at the clonal level showed that even CD271-MSCs are
   heterogeneous regarding their proliferative, differentiation and
   immunomodulatory potential^[47]7. Therefore, global gene expression
   analyses of unselected MSC preparations or MSC subsets would be a
   promising approach for their further characterization, e.g. for
   screening of functional differences and for identification of
   definitive markers of early MSC precursor cells and their more
   committed progeny. Specifically, with microarray technology testing
   differential gene expression patterns between multiple samples of
   interest can be identified hereby revealing major genomic differences
   and unique biological markers specific to the target cell
   population^[48]8. Moreover, comparative transcriptome analyses showed
   molecular similarities between human adipose tissue-derived MSCs and
   bone marrow-derived MSCs^[49]9. In addition, da Silva Meirelles et
   al.^[50]10 demonstrated the high transcriptomic similarity between
   cultured pericytes and MSCs derived from adipose tissue. Roson-Burgo et
   al.^[51]11 assessed dissimilarities between bone marrow and
   placenta-derived MSCs by identifying differentially expressed genes of
   microenvironment processes involved in the regulation of bone formation
   and blood vessel morphogenesis and the cellular niche. Referring to the
   MSC source, significant differences were shown for the molecular
   phenotype of MSCs from bone marrow, adipose tissue and skin, pointing
   to ontological and functional differences^[52]12,[53]13. In line with
   this, Gaafar et al.^[54]14 demonstrated that endometrium-derived MSCs
   feature similarities with BM-MSCs such as a similar core genetic
   profile. Although this profile included genes related to stemness, also
   genes of specific functions such as vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, cell
   adhesion, growth proliferation, migration, and differentiation of
   endothelial cells were upregulated^[55]14. Analyzing the
   transcriptional profile of aging, Alves et al.^[56]15 discovered
   follistatin as a common marker for aging in human and rats. According
   to the authors, this gene signature could be a useful tool for drug
   testing to rejuvenate human MSCs or for the selection of more potent
   MSC subpopulations for cell-based therapy^[57]15. There are, however,
   only few reports on the genetic signature of MSC subsets. Rennert et
   al.^[58]16 described a BM-MSC subset expressing genes of factors that
   support neuronal growth, differentiation and survival. Churchman et
   al.^[59]17 demonstrated for a distinct subset of native bone
   marrow-derived MSC a gene signature relating to various functions which
   reflects their micro-anatomic localization in the bone. Moreover, they
   suggest that this in vivo signature of MSC is substantially different
   from that of their ex vivo-expanded counterpart.

   To better understand this complexity we compared in the current study
   for the first time the molecular fingerprint (global gene expression)
   of expanded CD271-MSCs with the transcriptome of non-selected, plastic
   adherent MSCs (PA-MSCs).

Results

   Mesenchymal stromal cells generated from CD271+ positively selected
   BM-MNCs as well as PA-MSCs met the minimal ISCT-criteria^[60]18 as to
   their phenotype (Fig. [61]1b) and functional properties such as
   mesodermal tri-lineage differentiation (Fig. [62]1c). In order to
   evaluate differences in genetic signature of CD271-MSCs and PA-MSCs, we
   employed microarray analysis (Fig. [63]1d).

   CD271+ BM-MNCs were used to generate CD271-MSCs compared to PA-MSCs
   which were generated from non-selected BM-MNCs. From each donor (n = 3)
   both types of MSCs were expanded for 3 passages. A representative
   phenotype (b) and a tri-lineage differentiation potential of CD271-MSCs
   (c) are presented. From both types of ex vivo expanded MSCs was
   isolated total RNA which was used to perform the microarray analysis
   (d).

Major findings of the microarray data analysis

   We assessed the expression levels of 34,127 transcripts of CD271-MSCs
   and PA-MSCs generated from 3 healthy bone marrow donors. Transcriptome
   analysis revealed that in CD271-MSCs 115 genes were upregulated and 131
   genes were down-regulated when compared to PA-MSCs (Fig. [66]2).

   respectively.

   The upregulated genes in CD271-MSCs were primarily cell surface
   molecules, particularly IL12RB, CD3G, NCAM1 and CXCR7 (Fig. [68]3a). As
   to downregulated genes, the expression differences were greatest for
   genes encoding cell surface molecules, or components of the
   cytoskeleton including AMIGO3, ACTG2, and KRT28, (Fig. [69]3b).

Functional Enrichment Analysis

   Upregulated or downregulated genes in CD271-MSCs compared to PA-MSCs
   were annotated with categories for biological functions and processes,
   or associations with pathways, respectively. These functional
   associations were summarized based on Gene Ontology (GO) databases for
   biological processes or pathways, respectively. The bar charts in
   Fig. [72]4 show the number of genes associated with each category. The
   tables within these figures indicate if a category was significantly
   enriched (corrected p-value ≤ 0.05; Fisher’s exact test followed by
   multiple testing correction)^[73]19. As shown in Fig. [74]4a, the
   categories “extracellular matrix” and “cell adhesion” were
   significantly enriched among genes upregulated in CD271-MSCs compared
   to PA-MSCs. In addition, GO terms associated with up- and
   down-regulated genes in CD271-MSCs versus PA-MSCs are summarized in a
   forest plot presented in Fig. [75]5.

   unadjusted p-value ≤ 5% (GO; [80]http://www.geneontology.org) in the
   CD271-MSC versus PA-MSC analysis. Total numbers of genes related to a
   GO term are given in the third row. Sizes of boxes correspond to this
   number. Colors of boxes indicate GO terms related to cell cycle
   (orange), to DNA, RNA or chromosome (blue), to adhesion (brown) and to
   metabolism (green).

   Genes that were lower expressed in CD271-MSCs than in PA-MSCs are
   mainly associated with differentiation, particularly known for cells
   involved in immunoregulatory processes. Specifically, the following
   categories were significantly enriched: cell proliferation and
   differentiation, innate immunity and inflammation, T-cell immunity,
   receptor signaling, including kinase/phosphatase signaling particularly
   of the SAP-signaling cascade and angiogenesis. Only the set of
   downregulated genes showed a significant correlation with the relevant
   WNT and TGF-beta signaling pathways (Fig. [81]4c)), which may affect
   the cytoskeleton and the proliferation of the cells. In addition,
   cytokine/chemokine signaling pathways were significantly enriched, thus
   confirming the aforementioned altered expression of immunoregulatory
   molecules. Figures [82]6 and [83]7 highlight the results of
   differential expression analysis related to KEGG WNT signaling and cell
   cycle pathway, respectively^[84]20.

   To find out whether the differential mRNA expression of selected cell
   surface markers correlated with their respective protein expression on
   the surface of CD271-MSCs and PA-MSCs, we performed flow cytometry
   analysis with specific antibodies (Fig. [89]8a) for CD56 (NCAM-1),
   CD273 (PD-L2), CD274 (PD-L1) (Fig. [90]8b). In accordance with
   microarray assay results, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated a
   significantly higher percentage of positive cells for NCAM-1 in
   CD271-MSCs, in contrast to CD273 and CD271 which showed significantly
   higher levels in the PA-MSCs (Fig. [91]8b). Notably, intracellular and
   membrane immunostaining of both MSC populations at P1 and P3 with the
   specific antibody against CD271 antigen, demonstrated a significantly
   higher percentage of cells expressing this protein in CD271-MSCs vs.
   PA-MSCs at P1. Upon passaging (P3) the percentage of CD271 positive
   cells was higher, but did not reach significance (Fig. [92]8c). In
   contrast to microarray data, the IL12RB2 protein expression on the
   membrane of CD271-MSCs was not different compared to PA-MSCs (data not
   shown).

   cells were significantly lower in CD271-MSCs compared to PA-MSCs. Data
   is shown normalized to the respective PA-MSCs, N = 3 donors; each donor
   was analyzed at P3 and P4 in 3 independent experiments- paired
   Student’s t-test. (c) On protein level percentage of CD271 positive
   cells with both intracellular and membrane localization of CD271 was
   significantly higher in CD271-MSCs compared to PA-MSCs at P1. Upon

   higher but did not reach significance. Data is shown normalized to the
   respective PA-MSCs, N = 3 donors- paired Student’s t-test.

Discussion

   Mesenchymal stromal cells are multipotent cells endowed with
   immunomodulatory and regenerative properties^[95]21. However, MSCs
   exhibit considerable donor-to-donor and intra-population heterogeneity
   even at the clonal level, which poses a significant obstacle in
   research and in efforts to develop clinical manufacturing protocols
   that reproducibly generate functionally equivalent MSC
   populations^[96]3,[97]4,[98]7. Moreover, specific markers that identify
   progenitor cells for MSCs in vitro or in vivo have not been found yet
   posing a considerable challenge for our understanding of MSC ontogeny
   and for developing reliable potency assays for MSC therapies.
   Therefore, whole genome microarray analysis which, as a screening
   technology, allows unbiased testing of differential gene expression
   patterns between multiple samples of interest can help to identify
   major genomic differences and unique biological markers specific to the
   target cell population^[99]8. In a very recent study single cell
   RNA-seq technology was used to identify distinct cell clusters that
   were defined by cell surface marker combinations (e.g. PDPN, CD146,
   CD73 and CD164) leading to the identification of unique skeletal stem
   cells in humans^[100]22. However, to date, there are only few reports
   dealing with the molecular signature of MSC subsets^[101]17.

   In the current study, we therefore analyzed the genetic signature of
   CD271-MSCs compared to the standard PA-MSCs. Our microarray results
   showed that the upregulated genes in CD271-MSCs compared to PA-MSCs
   were significantly enriched for extracellular matrix (e.g., TNXB, ELN,
   ABI3BP, LAMA2, NOV) and chondrogenesis genes, (ACAN, MMP13, SOX8). As
   MSC-derived extracellular matrix (MSC-ECM) is a natural biomaterial
   with robust bioactivity and biocompatibility, a recent report^[102]23
   demonstrated that human ECM may be effectively used as a culture
   substrate for chondrocyte expansion in vitro, as well as a scaffold for
   chondrocyte-based cartilage repair. Bearing in mind that ECM gene
   transcripts were significantly higher expressed in CD271-MSCs it is not
   surprising that they have a greater chondrogenic differentiation
   potential than PA-MSCs in both in vitro and in vivo conditions as
   recently demonstrated by Mifune et al.^[103]24. We found that
   CD271-MSCs expressed also higher levels (1–1.5 fold) of transcripts
   that are relevant for the early osteogenesis, chondrogenesis and
   adipogenesis (ZNF145, FKBP5)^[104]25,[105]26. This may explain the
   presence of a higher content of transcripts in CD271-MSCs that enable
   both early and late osteogenesis (DPT, OMD, ID4, CRYAB,
   SORT1)^[106]27,[107]28. In line with this, we also found a higher
   expression of transcripts for early (CTNNB1, ZEB) and late (LPL, FABP4,
   PDK4, ACDC) adipogenesis in CD271-MSCs. This is in consent with
   previous reports on temporal gene expression changes during adipogenic
   differentiation of bone marrow-derived and adipose-derived
   MSCs^[108]25,[109]29. As the CD271 antigen is a low-affinity nerve
   growth receptor (L-NGFR) we asked whether CD271-MSCs express higher
   transcript levels of genes related to neurogenesis. Indeed, these MSCs
   contained more neurogenesis-associated gene transcripts and nerve
   growth factors than PA-MSCs (synaptotagmin 2, 4, 9, 12, 14, NEGR1,
   EPHA4 and especially SOCS2). Previous studies report on neuron-like
   differentiation of BM- MSCs under specific induction media in
   vitro^[110]30,[111]31. Our observation might shed a new light on the
   current controversial discussion of MSC neural differentiation
   capacity. To validate the expressed transcripts for cell surface
   markers we assessed the protein expression of NCAM-1 (CD56), CD273, and
   CD274 on the surface of both MSC types. Expression profile of these
   antigens correlated with the levels of transcripts observed in
   microarray analysis.

   Analyzing CD271 protein expression, we show for the first time that the
   CD271 protein is present at significantly higher levels in the
   cytoplasm of CD271-MSCs compared to PA-MSCs at the start of the ex vivo
   culture (P1). In line with the microarray data, where no differential
   expression of CD271 mRNA was detected at P3, we found no significant
   difference of CD271 protein between the groups at P3, indicating its
   downregulation upon passaging. In contrast, the IL12RB2 protein
   expression on the membrane of CD271-MSCs was not different compared to
   PA-MSCs and therefore, did not correlate with the microarray data. This
   is in line with previous reports which showed that steady state protein
   concentrations are determined by key processes e.g. transcription, mRNA
   decay, translation, and protein degradation. As a consequence, mRNA
   levels cannot always be used as surrogates for corresponding protein
   levels without verification. Specifically, only approximately 40% of
   cellular protein levels can be predicted from mRNA measurement which is
   a limitation of our study^[112]32,[113]33. Numerous studies reported
   that human bone marrow-derived MSCs produce a series of growth factors,
   which actively support long-term hematopoiesis either in vitro or in
   vivo^[114]34,[115]35. We recently showed also that CD271-MSCs support
   the multilineage differentiation of CD133^+ human hematopoietic stem
   cells in vivo in a xenogeneic mouse model^[116]6. Our microarray
   analysis, however, did not show significant differences in expression
   of hematopoiesis-supporting gene transcripts (CXCL12, FLT3L, IL-3, TPO,
   KITL, JAG-1, M-CSF and G-CSF) by CD271-MSCs compared to PA-MSCs.

Conclusion

   Taken together, transcriptome analysis demonstrated that 115 genes were
   higher expressed in CD271-MSCs than in PA-MSCs. Higher expressed genes
   encoded for cell surface molecules such as IL12Rβ2, CD3G, NCAM1, CXCR7
   and other molecules. In addition, functional enrichment analysis
   revealed that highly expressed genes in CD271-MSCs were significantly
   associated with extracellular matrix and cell adhesion processes. On
   the other hand, down-regulated genes in CD271-MSCs were mainly
   associated with differentiation, inflammation processes and
   angiogenesis. Notably, downregulated genes in CD271-MSCs were
   associated with WNT and TGF-beta signaling pathways as well as
   cytokine/chemokine signaling pathways. These data provide a first step
   for unraveling the key molecular signature of a functionally relevant
   human BM-derived MSC subset with promising clinical regenerative and
   immunomodulatory potential.

Material and Methods

Generation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)

   This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
   and had been approved by local ethics authorities (Ethikkommission of
   Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Medical Faculty, Frankfurt, project
   number 41/08). Bone marrow aspirates were isolated from 3 healthy
   volunteers after they provided written informed consent. Selection of
   CD271^+ bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) was performed using the
   MSC Research Tool Box–CD271 (LNGFR)-APC (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH,
   Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany), according to manufacturer’s instructions.
   Subsequently, selected CD271^+ BM-MNCs were cultured at a density 5,000
   cells/cm^2 in DMEM low-glucose supplemented with 10% MSC-qualified
   fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) for
   approximately one week. Once the MSCs (CD271-MSCs) appeared and grew to
   a confluence of roughly 60–70%, they were detached with TrypLE
   (Invitrogen) and further cultured at a density of 2 × 10e3 MSCs/cm^2
   for 3 passages. MSCs generated by simply using the plastic adherence of
   BM-MNCs from the same donors were designated as PA-MSCs^[117]6. They
   were cultured in the same medium and at the same cell concentrations to
   be used as a control for CD271-MSCs. Phenotypic characterization and
   differentiation potential of both types of MSCs were assessed as
   previously reported^[118]36.

Isolation of RNA and microarray data analysis

   RNA from 6 samples (3 CD271-MSCs and 3 PA-MSCs) from three different
   allogeneic donors was isolated at passage 3. The RNA quality was
   calculated by a proprietary algorithm of the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
   expert software. Raw intensity data were extracted from Feature
   Extraction output files for Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo
   Microarrays 8 × 60 K (Agilent Technologies, Inc) using Rosetta Resolver
   software (Rosetta, Inpharmatics, LLC.)^[119]37. Briefly, intensity
   values were normalized between the arrays using quantile normalization.
   Log2 transformed normalized intensity values were used for subsequent
   statistical analysis^[120]38.

   The Agilent Feature Extraction Software (FES) was used to read out and
   process the microarray image files. The software determines feature
   intensities (including background subtraction), rejects outliers and
   calculates statistical confidences. For determination of differential
   gene expression FES derived output data files were further analyzed
   using the Rosetta Resolverâ gene expression data analysis system
   (Rosetta Biosoftware). This software offers, among other features, the
   possibility to compare intensity profiles in a ratio experiment. All
   samples were labeled with Cy3, here, the ratio experiments are
   designated as control versus (vs.) sample experiments (automated data
   output of the Resolverâ system). The ratios (fold changes) were always
   calculated by dividing sample signal intensity by control signal
   intensity^[121]39.

   Gene expression differences between CD271-MSCs and PA-MSCs were
   assessed with paired t-tests. The method from Benjamini and
   Hochberg^[122]19 was applied to correct the calculated p-values for
   multiple testing. Genes/transcripts were considered as differentially
   expressed when they passed the filtering criteria of an unadjusted
   p-value of 0.05 or less, and a fold change difference of at least
   1.5-fold up- or down-regulation between the CD271-MSC samples and
   PA-MSC samples^[123]37.

Hierarchical clustering analysis

   Genes differentially expressed between CD271-MSCs and PA-MSCs were
   hierarchically clustered (Euclidean distance, complete linkage)^[124]40
   and displayed in heatmap images using Multiple Experiment Viewer
   software (MeV. Version 4.6.2)^[125]41. For visualization log2 ratios
   were calculated between the log2-intensities of each CD271-MSCs sample
   relative to the corresponding PA-MSCs sample derived from the same bone
   marrow donor.

Functional Enrichment Analysis

   Genes were annotated with information from Gene Ontology (GO), which
   provides information on molecular function, as well as various pathway
   resources for information on involvement in biological signaling
   pathways^[126]42. The Gene Ontology, biological processes/functions
   were used for the generation of ‘migo_bp’ annotations, and Gene
   Ontology pathways was the source of curated ‘migo_pathways’. The
   results are displayed in a bar chart, which gives an overview of the
   biological categories found most frequently among the genes of the
   input gene set. For an assessment of the true enrichment of a category,
   Fisher’s exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction^[127]19 for
   multiple testing was applied. Values of P ≤ 0.05 indicate a significant
   enrichment relative to the background (whole gene sets with
   corresponding Entrez-IDs of the Agilent 8 × 60 K Whole Human Genome
   Oligo Microarray) of the respective category^[128]37. Moreover,
   statistical software R-3.4.1 ([129]https://www.R-project.org) with
   additional package forestplot_1.7.2
   ([130]https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forestplot) was used to create
   Fig. [131]4. R-package piano_1.16.4^[132]43 was applied for KEGG
   enrichment analysis based on Fisher’s exact test and curated KEGG gene
   sets from MSigDB ([133]http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb).
   KEGG pathway plots (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) were
   generated using the “User data mapping” tool on the KEGG website
   ([134]http://www.kegg.jp)^[135]20.

Flow cytometry analysis

   To analyze cell surface expression of marker proteins that were
   differentially expressed on mRNA level, MSCs of both types at passage 3
   were stained with 7-AAD viability dye (eBiosciences, ThermoFisher

   from BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany): anti-CD56-PE (clone B159),
