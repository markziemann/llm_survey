Thinking...
We need to examine the article for details on pathway enrichment analysis.

Search for "enrichment" in the text: we saw "Gene ontology localization enrichment", "Gene ontology cell process enrichment", "Metacore®", etc.

In Additional files, Table S5: "Gene ontology localization enrichment on significantly regulated phospho-proteins after 5, 30 and 60 min of glucose stimulation. ... The table displays a cell process enrichment analysis (p-value and false discovery rate, FDR)". They used Metacore®.

In main text Results: "Gene ontology localization enrichment on significantly regulated phospho-proteins". Likely they used Metacore.

Also "Gene ontology cell process enrichment" etc.

Thus the tool: Metacore® (by Thomson Reuters). Not described version.

Gene set libraries: Gene Ontology (GO) (cellular component? process?), perhaps also Metacore's own ontologies.

Background list: Not described.

Statistical test: Not described? Might be hypergeometric test but not mentioned. The KSEA analysis uses statistical significance of KSEA score; but that's not enrichment.

In Additional file 5: "Kinase-substrate enrichment analysis" (KSEA) but that's for kinases, not pathways.

Thus for pathway enrichment: they used Metacore® for gene ontology enrichment.

Version: Not described.

Gene set libraries: Gene ontology (cell process). Possibly also Mitocarta for mitochondrial proteins but that's not enrichment.

Background list: Not described.

Statistical test: Not described.

Multiple testing correction: They mention "p-value (* ** p<0.001; ** p<0.01; * p<0.05)" and also "false discovery rate, FDR". In Table S5 description: "The table displays a cell process enrichment analysis (p-value and false discovery rate, FDR)". So yes, multiple testing correction applied.

Thus answer.

Now format table with rows for each question.

...done thinking.
