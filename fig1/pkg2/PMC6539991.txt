Abstract

   Cervical, endometrial and vulvar cancer are three common types of
   gynecological tumor that threaten the health of females worldwide.
   Since their underlying mechanisms and associations remain unclear, a
   comprehensive and systematic bioinformatics analysis is required. The
   present study downloaded [33]GSE63678 from the GEO database and then
   performed functional enrichment analyses, including gene ontology and
   pathway analysis. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms
   underlying the three types of gynecological cancer, protein-protein
   interaction (PPI) analysis was performed. A biological network was
   generated with the guidance of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
   Genomes database and was presented in Cytoscape. A total of 1,219 DEGs
   were identified for the three types of cancer, and 25 hub genes were
   revealed. Pathway analysis and the PPI network indicated that four main
   types of pathway participate in the mechanism of gynecological cancer,
   including viral infections and cancer formation, tumorigenesis and
   development, signal transduction, and endocrinology and metabolism. A
   preliminary gynecological cancer biological network was constructed.
   Notably, following all analysis, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
   (PI3K)/Akt pathway was identified as a potential biomarker pathway.
   Seven pivotal hub genes (CCNA2, CDK1, CCND1, FGF2, IGF1, BCL2 and
   VEGFA) of the three gynecological cancer types were proposed. The seven
   hub genes may serve as targets in gynecological cancer for prevention
   and early intervention. The PI3K/Akt pathway was identified as a
   critical biomarker of the three types of gynecological cancer, which
   may serve a role in the pathogenesis. In summary, the present study
   provided evidence that could support the treatment of gynecologic
   tumors in the future.

Introduction

   A gynecological tumor is a type of malignant tumor that occurs in the
   female reproductive system and seriously threatens the life of the
   patient. Among the types of gynecological tumor, cervical cancer (CC),
   endometrial carcinoma (EC) and vulvar carcinoma (VC) are the top three
   most common tumors of the female genital system, besides ovarian cancer
   ([34]1). Despite an overall decline in the incidence and mortality
   rates due to increased understanding of the disease, gynecological
   cancer remains a significant health care burden worldwide ([35]1).
   Early detection and treatment are essential for improving patient
   outcomes; however, these require improved understanding of the
   molecular pathology of the disease, in addition to identification of
   appropriate biomarkers and drug targets. Previous studies have
   demonstrated that the occurrence of CC is closely associated with human
   papillomavirus (HPV) infection ([36]2–[37]4). VC can be separated into
   two types, including one type that more frequently occurs in young
   females. This type involves the progression of a vulvar intraepithelial
   neoplasia caused by HPV infection, particularly HPV 16 and 18 ([38]5).
   Based on pathogenetic perspectives, EC is also classified into two
   groups according to estrogen dependence ([39]6). Although there have
   been a number of previous etiology studies, the exact pathogenesis of
   these three types of cancer remains unclear.

   There are certain pathological and etiological associations between CC
   and VC, as both are squamous cell cancers and both are associated with
   HPV infection ([40]2,[41]5). Unlike CC and VC, EC is associated with
   sex hormones, which is similar to common invasive tumors in females,
   including breast and ovarian cancer ([42]6). In addition, clinical
   diagnoses of these three cancer types rely predominantly on pathology
   ([43]7). Precise biomarkers in early stages of CC, EC and VC remain
   unknown.

   It is understood that cervical, endometrial and vulvar tissues all
   originate from the same embryological origin, the paramesonephric
   ducts, which give rise to the whole female reproductive tract and
   develop into different organs, following complex regulatory process
   ([44]8). For this reason, although there a number of differences
   between CC, EC and VC, it has been hypothesized that these three types
   of gynecological tumor share a similar mechanism and certain specific
   marker molecules may be common to their tumorigenesis and development.
   Therefore, a comprehensive analysis may improve understanding of these
   three types of tumor.

   Advancements in biotechnology have improved the availability of
   high-throughput data, including genomic, proteomic and metabolomics
   data, which supports in-depth scientific research. High-throughput data
   can assist with effective early diagnosis, prognosis prediction and
   investigations of molecular mechanisms for numerous types of disease.
   The present study used [45]GSE63678 microarray data downloaded from the
   Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to determine the differentially expressed
   genes (DEGs, which were identified between cancerous samples and
   non-cancerous samples) of CC, EC and VC ([46]9). Subsequently,
   functional enrichment analyses were performed, including gene ontology
   (GO) and pathway analysis, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI)
   network was generated to identify the significant biological terms
   associated with the DEGs. The genes that were screened out by the PPI
   network were considered as the hub genes, which may serve important
   roles in the mechanism of CC, EC and VC. In addition, a gene-pathway
   network was constructed and further analysis was performed. The
   complete flowchart of the present study is presented in [47]Fig. 1. In
   summary, the current study may provide a new perspective for
   elucidating the biological significance of three types of gynecological
   cancer, and assist with the identification of potential candidate
   biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

Materials and methods

Microarray data

   The gene expression profile [50]GSE63678 on the platform of the
   [51]GPL571 Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array was downloaded from
   the GEO database ([52]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). [53]GSE63678
   is a dataset submitted by Pappa et al ([54]9), containing 18 cancer
   samples, including five cervical, seven endometrial and six vulvar
   samples, and 17 normal samples, including, five cervical, five
   endometrial and seven vulvar samples.

Identification of DEGs

   GEO2R ([55]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r) is an interactive
   network analysis tool of the GEO database based on R, in which two sets
   of samples can be compared under the same experimental conditions
   ([56]10). Associated gene data were divided into CC, EC and VC groups.
   Subsequently, the GEO2R ([57]10) tool and limma package ([58]11)
   available through Bioconductor (version 3.8) of R Studio (version 3.5)
   were used to compare the gene expression of the CC, EC and VC groups.
   P<0.05 and a fold-change >2 were considered to indicate a DEG. The
   distribution of the DEGs in the three tumor types was presented as a
   Venn diagram using FunRich software (version 3.0) ([59]12).

Construction of the PPI network and identification of hub genes

   Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes
   ([60]http://string-db.org/; version 10.5) is a software system that is
   commonly used to search for known proteins and predict interactions
   ([61]13). The experimentally validated interactions with a combined
   score >0.7 were selected as significant and DEGs with a connection
   number <2 were removed. The PPI network was visualized using Cytoscape
   ([62]https://cytoscape.org/; version 3.6.0). The nodes with degree,
   closeness and betweenness scores higher than the mean, as calculated by
   the Cytoscape plugin Centiscape, were considered hub nodes.

GO analysis of the hub genes

   WEB-based Gene SeT AnaLysis Toolkit ([63]http://www.webgestalt.org/;
   revision 2017) is a popular software tool for functional enrichment
   analysis, which covers seven biological contexts, including GO
   ([64]14). Therefore, this software was used in the present study for GO
   enrichment analysis. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set at <0.05 to
   conduct the GO analysis of the DEGs.

Pathway enrichment analysis of the hub genes

   The hub genes were uploaded to ToppGene
   ([65]https://toppgene.cchmc.org/,) for pathway enrichment analysis. The
   two frequently used databases, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes
   (KEGG; [66]www.genome.jp/kegg) and Biocarta ([67]www.biocarta.com),
   were used to perform this analysis ([68]15). The FDR was set at <0.05.

Pathway crosstalk analysis

   The enriched pathways were recruited for further crosstalk analysis to
   investigate the associations between them. As described previously
   ([69]15), to measure the association between two pathways, Jaccard
   coefficient (JC)=A∩B/A∪B and overlap coefficient (OC)=A∩B/min(|A|,|B|)
   were adopted, where A and B are the gene items contained in the two
   pathways, min is the minimum, ∩ is the intersection of A and B, and ∪
   is the union of A and B. Since limited biological information was
   available, pathways containing <3 genes were excluded. Similarly, the
   pathway pairs with <2 overlapping genes were removed. Subsequently, the
   pathway network was presented with Cytoscape according to the JC and OC
   value of each selected pair ([70]16), and the MCODE plug-in ([71]17)
   (version 1.4.2; [72]apps.cytoscape.org/apps/MCODE) for Cytoscape was
   used to find clusters and highly interconnected regions in any network
   was used to analyze the clusters.

Gene-pathway network analysis

   To further investigate the developmental mechanisms of CC, EC and VC,
   the hub genes were mapped into a crosstalk network. By analyzing the
   interactions between the genes and pathways with KEGG and Biocarta, the
   connected nodes were linked with arrows. The gene-pathway network was
   constructed and visualized in Cytoscape. The degree was calculated and
   nodes with a degree greater than the mean degree of all nodes were
   selected to constitute a sub network.

Results

Identification of DEGs

   Following screening with the criteria of P<0.05 and fold-change >2, a
   total of 1,219 DEGs were identified. In the CC group 138 DEGs were
   revealed, including 87 upregulated genes. In addition, 479 DEGs were
   identified in the EC group, including 272 upregulated genes. Finally,
   734 DEGs, including 172 upregulated genes, were revealed in the VC
   group. As demonstrated in [73]Fig. 2A, 84, 378 and 630 DEGs were
   exclusively identified in CC, EC and VC groups, respectively. However,
   23 DEGs were present in both the CC and EC group, 73 DEGs were
   identified in both the EC and VC groups, and 26 DEGs were revealed in
   both the CC and VC groups. Furthermore, five mutual genes, including
   signal sequence receptor subunit 1 (SSR1), flap structure-specific
   endonuclease 1 (FEN1), cyclin A2 (CCNA2), signal transducer and
   activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand
   12 (CXCL12), were identified in all three groups.

Hub genes and PPI network

   Following calculation by Centiscape, the mean values of degree,
   closeness and betweenness were 12.64080, 3.73×10-4 and 2081.81034,
   respectively. Additionally, 25 hub genes were identified, including six
   downregulated genes and 19 upregulated genes ([76]Table I). Three
   histone cluster family members were revealed as hub genes, including
   histone H2B type 1-H (HIST1H2BH), histone cluster 1 H2B family member D
   (HIST1H2BD) and histone cluster 1 H2B family member K (HIST1H2BK), and
   the five hub genes were cell cycle regulatory proteins, including
   CCNA2, cyclin B1 (CCNB1), cyclin D1 (CCND1), aurora kinase A (AURKA)
   and cell division cycle 20 (CDC20). Furthermore certain genes
   associated with tumor progression were identified, including vascular
   endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), FYN proto-oncogene, Src family
   tyrosine kinase (FYN), baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5 (BIRC5) and
   the apoptosis regulator B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2).

   The PPI network of the 25 hub genes with 25 nodes and 114 edges is
   presented in [78]Fig. 2B. The top five genes with the highest degrees
   were CDK1, CCNB1, CDC20, CCNA2 and AURKA. All five of these genes are
   associated with cell cycle regulation, which indicates that cell cycle
   dysfunction serves an important role in the development of
   gynecological tumors.

GO enrichment analysis

   A total of 25 DEGs were used to perform GO enrichment analysis
   ([79]Fig. 2C). For cellular component terms, 22 out of the 25 genes
   were revealed to be located in the ‘nucleus’ and approximately 80% were
   identified to participate in the ‘macromolecular complex’ (19 genes)
   and ‘membrane-enclosed lumen’ (18 genes). In the biological process
   category, the DEGs were associated with ‘biological regulation’ (22
   genes), ‘metabolic process’ (22 genes), ‘cellular component
   organization’ (21 genes) and ‘response to stimulus’ (21 genes). In the
   molecular function category all 25 DEGs were associated with ‘protein
   binding’ (25 genes).

Pathway enrichment analysis of the hub genes

   By uploading the 25 genes into ToppGene, 86 significant pathways were
   identified. The biological processes involved in these pathways can be
   divided into the following five main categories: i) viral infections
   and cancer formation, including ‘viral carcinogenesis’ and ‘hepatitis
   B’, ii) tumorigenesis and development, including ‘colorectal cancer’
   and ‘proteoglycans in cancer’, iii) signal transduction, including
   ‘PI3K-Akt signaling pathway’ and ‘AMPK signaling pathway’, iv)
   endocrinology and metabolism, including ‘AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in
   diabetic complications’ and ‘endocrine resistance’, and v) others,
   including ‘genes encoding secreted soluble factors’ and ‘NFAT and
   hypertrophy of the heart (transcription in the broken heart)’. In
   addition, 19 pathways were identified to be downregulated and 17
   pathways were revealed to be upregulated ([80]Table II).

Pathway crosstalk analysis

   To further investigate how the identified pathways interact with each
   other, a pathway crosstalk analysis was conducted among the pathways
   that met the criteria. The approach was based on the assumption that
   two pathways can be considered to be associated if they share a
   proportion of genes ([82]18). A total of 45 pathways contained more
   than two hub genes, of which 41 pathways met the criterion for
   crosstalk analysis.

   The network of crosstalk, which includes these 41 pathways, is
   presented in [83]Fig. 3A. The thickness of edge connecting two nodes
   represents the strength of the association between them, which was
   measured by the mean value of OC and JC. Using MCODE, two major
   clusters were identified from the whole network. The simple cluster
   involves three pathways associated with cell cycle, including ‘Cell
   cycle’, ‘Oocyte meiosis’ and ‘Cyclins and Cell Cycle Regulation’. The
   complicated cluster containing a total of 32 nodes and 376 edges is
   presented in [84]Fig. 3B. The five aforementioned types of pathways
   were interconnected to form the complex network, which indicates the
   complexity of the pathogenesis of CC, EC and VC.

Gene-pathway network construction of DEGs

   By mapping the hub genes into the complicated sub-network according to
   the KEGG and Biocarta databases, a potential gene-pathway network was
   constructed to verify the associations between the candidate pathways
   and genes ([87]Fig. 4). This network included 37 important pathways and
   18 hub genes, including CCND1 presented in the middle with direct or
   indirect associations with all other genes. As the only overlapping
   gene of all three groups, CCNA2 possessed complicated connections with
   ‘viral carcinogenesis’, ‘hepatitis B’, ‘cell cycle’ and six other
   pathways. In addition, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), fibroblast
   growth factor 2 (FGF2) and CCND1 were located close to the middle of
   the gene-pathway network.

Sub gene-pathway network of DEGs

   To screen the key factors, including genes and pathways, in the
   gene-pathway network, the degrees of all of nodes were calculated and
   nodes with a degree greater than the mean degree of all nodes were
   selected ([90]Fig. 5). Seven genes (CCNA2, CDK1, CCND1, BCL2, IGF1,
   FGF2 and VEGFA) and six pathways (‘Viral carcinogenesis’, ‘Hepatitis
   B’, ‘Focal adhesion’, ‘Pathways in cancer’, ‘PI3K-Akt signaling
   pathway’ and ‘Proteoglycans in cancer’) were selected. Since these gene
   and pathways had more connections with other nodes, they were
   considered to more likely serve a role in CC, EC and VS.

Discussion

   In the past few decades, gynecological cancer research has developed
   rapidly, particularly regarding the recognition of etiological factors.
   Although a number of studies have investigated CC, EC and VC
   separately, few studies have focused on these three types of cancer in
   combination. The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic
   and comprehensive analysis to investigate the pathogenesis of CC, EC
   and VC and make a preliminary assessment of the associations between
   these three cancer types.

   By performing an analysis of microarray data, 1,219 DEGs were
   identified, including 138 in CC, 479 in EC and 734 in VC. Five DEGs
   were revealed in all three cancer types, which suggests these genes may
   participate in a number of important biological processes in
   gynecological cancer and may serve as crucial biomarkers following
   further research. Together with the 25 hub genes identified, these data
   may provide a direction for future research on gynecological cancer and
   assist with the identification of clinical biological targets.

   Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that 86 pathways are closely
   associated with the 25 hub genes. In particular, it was identified that
   viral infection and carcinogenesis pathways were significantly
   enriched, including ‘viral carcinogenesis’, ‘HTLV-1 infection’ and
   ‘hepatitis B’, which supports the association of virus with the three
   gynecological cancer types, particularly CC. Furthermore,
   cancer-association pathways, including ‘pathways in cancer’ and
   ‘proteoglycans in cancer’ were revealed to be associated with the
   biological process of the three malignant tumor types. Notably,
   multiple different types of human cancer, including melanoma, prostate
   cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer and glioma, were also identified
   to be associated with the 25 hub genes. This indicates that
   gynecological cancer types may exhibit homologous mechanisms with tumor
   types of other systems.

   With the gene-pathway sub-network model, seven critical hub genes and
   six important pathways of the three gynecological cancer types were
   identified. The hub genes with the highest degrees included CDK1, which
   was enriched in CC and VC. As reported, CDK1 is a member of the Ser/Thr
   protein kinase family and is encoded by cell division cycle gene 2
   (cdc2) ([93]19). In addition, CDK1 has been revealed to serve a role in
   numerous types of cancer, including EC ([94]20), breast cancer ([95]21)
   and ovarian cancer ([96]22). Consistent with the present bioinformatics
   results, CDK1 has been demonstrated to serve a comprehensive role in
   mediating genetic networks involved in the progression of CC;
   therefore, it may be an important therapeutic target for improving
   prognosis ([97]23). A study regarding ovarian cancer identified that
   CDK1 is associated with proliferation and can serve as a prognostic
   factor in epithelial ovarian cancer ([98]22). In EC, the overexpression
   of CDK1 in endometrial carcinoma cells is closely associated with the
   occurrence of tumors, indicating a role in tumor prognosis ([99]24).
   The CDK1 gene can contribute to the carcinogenesis of HPV ([100]25),
   and CC and VC are associated with HPV infection; therefore, CDK1 may be
   an important molecule in the pathogenesis of gynecological tumors.

   Another cell cycle regulatory gene, CCNA2, was revealed as a shared DEG
   of CC, EC and VC, and complicated connections were identified between
   it and other nodes. According to recent studies, CCNA2 belongs to the
   highly conversed cyclin family and is expressed in multiple tissues in
   the human body, including numerous types of cancer, which indicates it
   may serve a role in cancer transformation and progression
   ([101]26,[102]27). Gao et al ([103]28) revealed that CCNA2 is a
   prognostic biomarker for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and
   is associated with Tamoxifen resistance. Combined with another
   biological analysis of EC that demonstrated CCNA2 is one of the top two
   upregulated nodes ([104]29), the present study hypothesizes that CCNA2
   serves a role as a biomarker in gynecological tumors ([105]29). In
   addition, a study associated with ovarian cancer revealed a similar
   result, in which CCNA2 was upregulated in the chemo-resistant
   epithelial ovarian cancer ([106]30). Therefore, it can be suggested
   that CCNA2 is a potential biomarker in gynecological cancer; however,
   this requires in vivo or in vitro experimental verification. CCND1 is
   an important positive regulator of the G1/S phase of the cell cycle and
   has been identified as a co-factor of HPV in the initiation of cervical
   carcinogenesis ([107]31). Similar studies regarding EC and VC have also
   widely been reported ([108]32–[109]34).

   BCL2 and IGF1 were revealed as the only two downregulated genes in the
   sub-network. BCL2 is an intracellular membrane protein that prevents
   apoptotic cell death and overexpression of BCL2 can block p53-mediated
   G1 arrest ([110]35). Kamaraddi et al ([111]36) demonstrated that BCL2
   expression is higher in malignant lesions compared with premalignant
   lesions, which differs from the current findings. It has been suggested
   that alterations of BCL2 expression are associated with early events in
   cervical tumorigenesis and a lower BCL2 expression level has also been
   demonstrated to be associated with an improved 5-year survival rate and
   prognosis ([112]37). The significance of BCL2 in gynecological tumors
   requires further investigation. Furthermore, IGF1 is closely associated
   with the occurrence of numerous tumor types; however, its exact
   mechanism remains unclear. Iyer et al ([113]38) identified that IGF-1
   expression levels in advanced CC increase with chemo-radiotherapy and
   decline during follow-up ([114]38). With a limited specificity in
   gynecologic tumors, IGF1 is of limited value in the early prediction of
   gynecological tumors; however it may serve a role in targeted treatment
   strategies, and the assessment and improvement of prognosis
   ([115]39,[116]40).

   Angiogenesis serves an important role in tumor growth, development,
   progression and metastasis ([117]41). As a pro-angiogenesis factor,
   VEGFA is involved in the proliferation, differentiation and migration
   of endothelial cells, and participates in the invasion and metastasis
   of numerous types of cancer ([118]42). Chen et al ([119]43)
   demonstrated that VEGFA may be a target for inhibiting angiogenesis in
   EC 42). Similarly, Hua and Tian ([120]44) revealed that CCL4 can
   promote cell proliferation, invasion and migration of EC by targeting
   the VEGFA signal pathway ([121]44). Combined with the present results,
   this indicates that VEGFA serves an important role in gynecological
   tumor invasion and metastasis.

   FGF2 is a typical fibroblast growth factor that stimulates the growth
   of various cell types, from fibroblasts to tumor cells ([122]45). In
   addition, FGF2 is a fundamental signaling molecule in tumor-induced
   angiogenesis ([123]46). It has been demonstrated that FGF2 is mitogenic
   in various cell types and is associated with the regulation of tumor
   angiogenesis and metastasis ([124]47). Certain studies regarding the
   receptor family of FGF2 have revealed that it is associated with the
   occurrence and development of CC, in addition to HPV16 infection
   ([125]48,[126]49). Aberrant FGF/FGF receptor signaling has been
   demonstrated in multiple types of tumor ([127]50,[128]51). The
   expression level of FGF2 has been revealed to be higher in EC compared
   with normal tissues, and the highest expression level was observed in
   tumors with dedifferentiation, myometrial invasion and advanced staging
   ([129]52). Therefore, angiogenesis has an important impact in the
   pathogenesis of gynecological cancers.

   ‘PI3K-Akt signaling pathway’, ‘hepatitis B’, ‘pathways in cancer’,
   ‘focal adhesion’, ‘viral carcinogenesis’ and ‘proteoglycans in cancer’
   were located in the sub-network, which indicates that these processes
   serve an important role in the pathogenesis of CC, EC and VC. It is
   understood that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway serves a central role in
   cell growth and proliferation, and it has also been suggested that its
   deregulation is associated with cancer ([130]53). Yung et al ([131]54)
   demonstrated that the activation of AMPK could significantly inhibit CC
   cell growth. Similar studies regarding the PI3K/Akt pathway in EC have
   also been reported ([132]55,[133]56), and it has been considered as a
   therapeutic target ([134]57). According to previous studies, the
   PI3K/Akt signaling pathway can serve as a therapeutic target in EC
   ([135]57) and ovarian cancer ([136]58,[137]59), and can be mediated by
   molecules, including VEGFA ([138]40). FGF2 has also been reported to
   serve an angiogenic role by the PI3K/Akt pathway ([139]60).
   Furthermore, BCL2 is a major downstream mediator of the PI3K/Akt
   pathway and serves a pivotal role in tumor response ([140]61,[141]62).
   It has been reported that CCNA2 expression promotes the migration,
   invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma and ovarian cancer
   cells via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway ([142]63). Therefore, this
   crucial pathway in cancer cells may be involved in the early
   developmental stages of formation and invasion. As indicated by the
   present results, the molecular mechanisms underlying CC, EC and VC are
   complicated, and further studies are required to fully understand their
   pathological mechanisms.

   Similarly, Suman and Mishra ([143]64) identified that the aurora kinase
   pathway has a crucial function in the pathogenesis of five
   gynecological cancer types, including breast cancer, EC, CC, ovarian
   cancer and VC, by analyzing the common core genes from the
   [144]GSE63678, [145]GSE57297 and [146]GSE26712 datasets. Furthermore,
   the present study identified seven genes (CCNA2, CDK1, CCND1, BCL2,
   IGF1, FGF2 and VEGFA) and six pathways (‘viral carcinogenesis’,
   ‘hepatitis B’, ‘focal adhesion’, ‘pathways in cancer’, ‘PI3K-Akt
   signaling pathway’ and ‘proteoglycans in cancer’) that may serve an
   important role in CC, EC and VC. A number of factors are involved in
   the progression of cancer; the present study focused on the factors
   associated with the female reproductive system. The results may provide
   comprehensive evidence that promotes the understanding of cancers of
   the female genital tract. While previous studies have focused on
   co-expressed DEGs ([147]23,[148]64), the present study aimed to
   establish a gene-pathway network based on the analysis of DEGs.
   Additionally, previous studies investigated genes co-expressed by the
   five cancer types (breast cancer, EC, CC, ovarian cancer and VC).
   However, the current study not only investigated the co-expressed DEGs
   of CC, EC and VC, but also examined the DEGs co-expressed by any
   combination of two of the cancer types. In summary, the current study
   focused of the associations between three types of tumor, which may
   make it more comprehensive compared with previous studies.

   Notably, there are certain limitations to the present study. The sample
   number was relatively small, which to a certain extent reduces the
   credibility of gene enrichment. Subject to conditions, long-term
   assessments of the patients' clinical conditions were not available. In
   addition, the literature regarding the pathways associated with CC, EC
   and EC, except for the PI3K/Akt pathway is limited; therefore, the
   present study lacked a solid foundation to adequately discuss the
   current results. Finally, certain genes that are associated with the
   pathogenesis of gynecological types of cancer may not have been
   statistically analyzed, possibly due to the exclusion criteria that was
   applied.

   In conclusion, the pathogenesis of CC, EC and VC is complicated. By
   performing a comprehensive analysis, the present study revealed a
   library of DEGs in CC, EC and VC, and identified 25 hub genes.
   Subsequently, viral infection, tumorigenesis, inflammation and the
   endocrine system were revealed to be involved in the development of
   these three types of cancer. Finally, a molecular network of CC, EC and
   VC was constructed. Most notably, it was identified that the PI3K/Akt
   pathway serves an important role in the three types of gynecological
   cancer and seven hub genes (CCNA2, CDK1, CCND1, FGF2, IGF1, BCL2 and
   VEGFA) present in the sub-network may act as therapeutic targets, and
   assist with early diagnosis and prevention. The present study may
   support the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms in CC, EC and VC,
   which would promote early detection and the development of targeted
   therapy. Further investigations that aim to improve understanding of
   the mechanisms of these three cancer types will be vital for developing
   highly sensitive and multifactorial strategies for the prevention,
   diagnosis and treatment of CC, VC and EC.
