Thinking...
We need to answer six questions about pathway enrichment analysis.

We must locate details in the Methods section about pathway enrichment analysis, also Results or Supplementary.

The article is about metabolomics. The enrichment analysis likely uses MetaboAnalyst's MetPA (Metabolite Pathway Analysis) or similar.

Let's search in the provided text: In Results section, there is "2.7 Pathway Enrichment Analysis" where they mention "The metabolic pathways that were significantly enriched were constructed using the MetaboAnalyst online platform (MetPA)". Let's check:

In the excerpt: "2.7. Pathway Enrichment Analysis

   We performed a pathway enrichment analysis using the MetaboAnalyst online platform (MetPA) [45] and identified a total of 12 pathways (Figure S2)."

They also later say "The significant pathways are shown in Table S2." So the tool used is MetaboAnalyst's MetPA. It might be a module of MetaboAnalyst.

In the Methods section 4.4 Statistical Analysis: "Metabolite enrichment was log transformed before being subjected to pathway analysis in MetaboAnalyst version 4.0 (Xia Lab, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada) [131]." Wait: In statistical analysis they say "Metabolite enrichment was log transformed before being subjected to pathway analysis in MetaboAnalyst version 4.0." That is for pathway analysis. So the tool is MetaboAnalyst version 4.0. Possibly they used MetPA (Metabolite Pathway Analysis) within MetaboAnalyst.

Thus answer: tool: MetaboAnalyst (version 4.0). Also mention MetPA (maybe considered part of MetaboAnalyst). But they explicitly mention "MetaboAnalyst version 4.0". Also "MetPA" is the pathway analysis module. So list both: MetaboAnalyst (v4.0). Optionally "MetPA" not a separate tool but a module; still list.

Version: 4.0.

Gene set libraries: Since metabolomics, they likely used KEGG. Did they mention KEGG? In the description of targeted pathway analysis: "MetPA analysis for targeted metabolites" (supplementary). They mention "Alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism (C00049: Asparate, C00025: Glutamate)". Likely they used KEGG pathways. But need explicit statement. Search: "Not described" maybe.

In the article they mention "MetPA", which uses KEGG pathways (but not stated). The article does not explicitly say "KEGG". So answer: Not described.

Custom background: Not described.

Statistical test(s): In MetaboAnalyst pathway analysis, they use hypergeometric test (maybe) but not stated. Need to see if they mention "Fisher's exact test". In text: not described. So answer "Not described".

Multiple testing correction: They mention "FDR" earlier in results: "The pathways...with highest impact and FDR." Wait, in 2.7 they said "Significant pathways are shown in Table S2." They may have used FDR for metabolite selection earlier, but for enrichment they mention "FDR" as part of significance. Let's read: "We performed a pathway enrichment analysis using the MetaboAnalyst online platform (MetPA) and identified a total of 12 pathways (Figure S2)." The results mention "Significant pathways (FDR < 0.05)". Actually earlier they talk about "global profiling" and "AUC analysis". In the pathway analysis they might mention "FDR" as part of the MetaboAnalyst output (it provides FDR). In the Methods they do not mention multiple testing correction. But maybe they mention "FDR" in the pathway enrichment results: In the result section "2.7 Pathway Enrichment Analysis" they might mention "False discovery rate (FDR)". Let's search: Provided excerpt: "The global metabolite profiling identified... The pathway enrichment analysis identified... The metabolic pathways that were significantly enriched were constructed using the MetaboAnalyst online platform (MetPA) (Figure S2). The significant pathways are shown in Table S2."

The snippet includes "Figure S2: Construction of the altered metabolism pathways using MetPA". But no explicit mention of FDR.

Later in targeted analysis: "Metabolite enrichment was log transformed before being subjected to pathway analysis in MetaboAnalyst version 4.0". No mention of correction.

Thus multiple testing correction: Not described.

Now compile answers.

We'll make a table with rows for each question and answer.
