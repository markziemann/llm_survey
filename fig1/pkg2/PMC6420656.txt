Abstract

   The major depressive disorder (MDD) working group of the Psychiatric
   Genomics Consortium (PGC) has published a genome-wide association study
   (GWAS) for MDD in 130,664 cases, identifying 44 risk variants. We used
   these results to investigate potential drug targets and repurposing
   opportunities. We built easily interpretable bipartite drug-target
   networks integrating interactions between drugs and their targets,
   genome-wide association statistics, and genetically predicted
   expression levels in different tissues, using the online tool Drug
   Targetor ([35]drugtargetor.com). We also investigated drug-target
   relationships that could be impacting MDD. MAGMA was used to perform
   pathway analyses and S-PrediXcan to investigate the directionality of
   tissue-specific expression levels in patients vs. controls. Outside the
   major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, 153 protein-coding genes
   are significantly associated with MDD in MAGMA after multiple testing
   correction; among these, five are predicted to be down or upregulated
   in brain regions and 24 are known druggable genes. Several drug classes
   were significantly enriched, including monoamine reuptake inhibitors,
   sex hormones, antipsychotics, and antihistamines, indicating an effect
   on MDD and potential repurposing opportunities. These findings not only
   require validation in model systems and clinical examination, but also
   show that GWAS may become a rich source of new therapeutic hypotheses
   for MDD and other psychiatric disorders that need new—and
   better—treatment options.

Introduction

   There is an urgent need for new drugs to better treat major depressive
   disorder (MDD), with new modes of action as well as fewer side effects.
   The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) has conducted a genome-wide
   association study (GWAS) of more than 130,664 MDD and broader
   depression cases and 330,470 controls identifying 44 loci associated
   with depression^[36]1. Much new biology is suggested by these findings
   and we hypothesize that the collection of loci discovered by GWAS may
   have the potential to restart largely paused drug development
   pipelines. This is not without considerable technical challenges. At
   the moment, time-consuming manual assessment by expert biologists and
   geneticists is required for each GWAS locus. Analyzing all genome-wide
   results together may allow better prioritization of potential drug or
   therapeutic hypotheses^[37]2,[38]3.

   GWAS associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and
   MDD can be used to assess the association of each gene or sets of
   genes, such as those defined by biological pathways. Pathway analysis
   has also been used to suggest new drug hypotheses by mapping drugs to
   the proteins they bind, and defining the sets of genes that encode the
   proteins as “drug gene-sets” whose association with a phenotype of
   interest can be estimated^[39]2,[40]4. This process is a type of drug
   repositioning analysis aimed at finding potential new uses for existing
   drugs^[41]2. In this paper, we propose to mine drug-protein/gene
   interactions from two main sources: drug-target relationships or
   “activity profiles”^[42]2 and drug effects on gene expression or
   “perturbagen signatures”^[43]5. Activity profiles can be derived from
   several databases such as PubChem BioAssays^[44]6 or ChEMBL^[45]7,
   while the main source for perturbagen signatures is the CMAP
   database^[46]5. Instead of using these resources separately, they can
   be used together to identify relevant drugs. However, simply generating
   the association between drug-gene-sets and phenotypes is not enough;
   each gene-set is a subnetwork with different interaction types between
   drugs and proteins. Visualising these interactions could allow better
   and more rapid prioritization of drug-gene-sets.

   For this purpose, it may be useful to translate activity profiles into
   bipartite drug-target interaction networks. These can be constructed by
   linking drug nodes to targets nodes where the links or edges represent
   the type of drug-target interaction. Maggiora et al.^[47]8 suggested
   that these networks could be used to assess drug polypharmacology—the
   ability of drugs to interact with several targets—as well as target
   polyspecificity—the ability of targets to exhibit affinity towards
   multiple dissimilar molecular compounds.

   In this paper, we build drug-target networks relevant to a given
   phenotype (MDD), by using the results from a well-powered PGC MDD GWAS
   for imputation of tissue-specific expression levels in patients vs.
   controls, and to generate genetic associations of known drug targets
   with MDD. Drug-target networks presented in this paper can be accessed
   on the Drug Targetor website ([48]drugtargetor.com), which provides the
   opportunity to build networks linking genetic data with a large number
   of drugs and drug classes, allowing detailed assessment of drug action
   possibly impacting MDD.

Materials and methods

Genome-wide association study of major depressive disorder

   The PGC MDD phase 2 analysis was a combined analysis of an anchor
   cohort of traditionally ascertained MDD cases and an expanded cohort of
   more diversely assessed depression cases. Briefly, the anchor cohort
   consisted of 29 samples of European ancestry (16,823 MDD cases and
   25,632 controls)^[49]1. Cases in the anchor cohort were required to
   meet international consensus criteria (DSM-IV, ICD-9, or ICD-10)^[50]9
   for a lifetime diagnosis of MDD. Controls were screened for the absence
   of lifetime MDD (22/29 samples). An “expanded” set of six independent,
   European-ancestry cohorts (113,841 MDD cases and 304,838 controls) were
   then considered. Generation Scotland employed direct interviews; iPSYCH
   (Denmark) used national treatment registers; deCODE (Iceland) used
   national treatment registers and direct interviews; GERA used
   Kaiser-Permanente (health insurance) treatment records (CA, US); UK
   Biobank combined self-reported MDD symptoms and/or treatment for MDD by
   a medical professional; and 23andMe used self-report of treatment for
   MDD by a medical professional. All controls were screened for the
   absence of MDD. A combination of polygenic scoring and linkage
   disequilibrium (LD) score genetic correlation comparisons between the
   anchor and expanded cohorts and samples showed strong evidence for
   genetic homogeneity between these groups^[51]1.

GWAS quality control and analysis

   See ref. ^[52]1 for full details. SNPs and insertion-deletion
   polymorphisms were imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project
   multi-ancestry reference panel^[53]10. In each cohort, logistic
   regression association tests were conducted for imputed marker dosages
   with principal components covariates to control for population
   stratification. Ancestry was evaluated using principal components
   analysis applied to directly genotyped SNPs^[54]11. Summary statistic
   for 10,468,942 autosomal SNPs were then available for the analyses we
   present.

Gene-based test of association

   We used MAGMA v1.06^[55]12 to perform a gene-based test of association
   with the MDD GWAS summary statistics. Briefly, MAGMA generates
   gene-based p-values by combining adjacent SNP-based p-values within a
   defined gene window while accounting for LD. SNPs were mapped to genes
   if they were located 35 kb upstream or 10 kb downstream of a gene body
   including regulatory regions, and the gene p-value is obtained using
   the “multi = snp-wise” option, which aggregates mean and top SNP
   association models. A Bonferroni p-value threshold of 2.63 × 10^−6,
   accounting for 19,079 ENSEMBL genes, was used to account for multiple
   testing. We used 1000 Genomes European data phase 3 as the reference LD
   set^[56]10.

Transcriptome-wide association

   To assess the impact of genetic variation underlying MDD on gene
   expression, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study using
   the S-PrediXcan software^[57]13. This approach estimates gene
   expression weights by training a linear prediction model in samples
   with both gene expression and SNP genotype data. The weights are then
   used to predict gene expression from GWAS summary statistics, while
   incorporating the variance and covariance of SNPs from a LD reference
   panel. We used pre-computed gene expression weights for 13 central
   nervous system (CNS) tissues (amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex BA24,
   caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, putamen, cerebellar hemisphere,
   cerebellum, cortex, frontal cortex BA9, hippocampus, hypothalamus,
   cervical spine C1, and substantia nigra) generated from the
   Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium v7^[58]14, and whole blood
   using the Depression Genes and Networks (DGN) cohort^[59]15. Only CNS
   tissues were considered to investigate potential drug targets for MDD;
   however, the DGN whole blood analysis was also performed because of its
   higher sample size (922 whole blood samples) and higher power to detect
   associations. 1000 Genomes European data phase 3 was used as the
   reference LD set^[60]10. These data were processed with beta values and
   standard errors from the MDD GWAS summary statistics to estimate the
   expression-GWAS association statistic. A transcriptome-wide
   significance threshold of P = 1.12 × 10^−6, adjusting for all GTEx CNS
   tissue and DGN associations (Bonferroni correction 0.05/44,718), was
   used to adjust for multiple testing.

Definition of the druggable genome

   Genes were annotated by “druggability” using the collection of 4479
   “druggable genes” from Finan et al.^[61]16 (henceforth referred to as
   the “druggable genome”) and divided into three “tiers” based on their
   importance in pharmaceutical development: tier 1 (T1) contains genes
   that encode protein targets of approved or clinical trial-phase drug
   candidates, tier 2 (T2) contains genes that encode protein targets with
   high sequence similarity to tier 1 proteins or targeted by small
   drug-like molecules, and tier 3 contains genes that encode secreted and
   extracellular proteins, genes belonging to the main druggable gene
   families, and genes encoding proteins with more restricted similarity
   to tier 1 targets. In the gene-based tests of association, genes were
   investigated whether or not they were present in this druggable genome;
   results in Supplementary Materials are ordered by druggability tier. It
   should be noted that targets not known as “druggable” are also worth
   investigating—“druggability” is a mutable concept, which evolves as
   more drug-target data is made available. Information on genes with
   human or mouse phenotypes were also collected from the human-mouse
   disease connection database (HDMC), which gathers mouse data from Mouse
   Genome Informatics database (MGI)^[62]17 and human data from the
   National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and Online
   Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)^[63]18.

Definition of drug-target and drug-gene interactions

   We collected two types of drug interactions: activity profiles
   (drug-target interactions) and perturbagen signatures (drug-gene
   interactions). Drug-target interactions are defined as any type of
   interaction between a drug and a protein target. Drug-gene interactions
   are changes in gene expression induced by a drug. We built an
   annotation dataset using interaction profiles from the drug-gene
   interaction database DGIdb v2.0^[64]19, ChEMBL v.23^[65]7,[66]20, the
   psychoactive drug-gene database PDSP K[i] DB, PHAROS^[67]21, NCBI
   PubChem BioAssay^[68]6, and DSigDB^[69]16,[70]22 (downloaded in June
   2017). We subset experimental data from the annotation dataset to
   generate a more reliable bioactivity dataset, with only curated ChEMBL
   and PDSP K[i] DB data. The broad annotation set was used to rank the
   drugs, but the bioactivity subset was used to check which drug classes
   were enriched when restricting analyses to curated experimental data. A
   description of the data curation approach is provided in Supplementary
   Text [71]1.

Enrichment of drug-gene-sets and therapeutic classes

   Approved drugs and their Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes
   were identified by mapping all drug names to their PubChem compound
   identifier (CID) using the PubChem synonym database
   ([72]ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/Extras/CID-Synonym-filtered.
   gz), then mapping each CID to the corresponding ATC codes. The drugs
   were merged by ATC name, which could correspond to several CID entries
   and ATC codes. Each drug was then mapped to a gene-set using the
   collected drug-gene and drug-target interactions, and assigned a
   p-value generated by competitive pathway analysis (MAGMA), assessing
   the association between drug-gene-set and phenotype. For the annotation
   set, 1946 drugs corresponding to 1748 individual gene-sets were tested;
   for the more reliable bioactivity set of ChEMBL and PDSP K[i] data,
   1160 drugs were mapped to 723 gene-sets. The area under the enrichment
   curve (AUC) and associated p-value from one-sided Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon
   (MWW) tests were used to assess the enrichment of drug classes, for
   each ATC hierarchical level. Since the annotation and bioactivity sets
   generated two different sets of pathway analysis p-values (drug ranks),
   MWW enrichment tests were carried out two times. The drugs were first
   ranked by MAGMA pathway analysis p-value, and the MWW test compared the
   drugs within one ATC level A to drugs not present in A, the alternative
   hypothesis being that the distribution of drugs in A is shifted to the
   right. The MWW test is adapted in this case since we have one
   continuous dependent variable (the pathway analysis p-value), and one
   independent variable consisting of two independent groups, with no
   overlap of instances between the two groups (drugs outside or inside a
   specific class). The Bonferroni threshold was estimated by dividing
   0.05 by the number of tested classes—57 and 141 for the bioactivity and
   annotation sets, respectively.

Bipartite drug-target networks

   Bipartite drug-target networks were built using Drug Targetor
   ([73]drugtargetor.com)^[74]23. The tool builds networks using three
   types of inputs: a drug table with drug-phenotype associations, a
   target table with target-phenotype associations, and connections
   between drugs and targets (cf. Figure [75]1). The drug-phenotype
   associations were obtained using MAGMA pathway analysis,
   target-phenotype associations using MAGMA gene-wise analysis and
   S-PrediXcan results, and the drug-target interactions were collected as
   described in the data collection section (cf. “Definition of
   drug-target and drug-gene interactions”). The networks are comprised of
   drug nodes and target nodes, the edges of which are connected based on
   the type of interaction. Drug Targetor defines nine types of
   drug-target interactions: increasing gene expression, decreasing gene
   expression, mixed (increasing or decreasing) gene expression,
   agonist/activator/positive allosteric modulator, partial agonist,
   antagonist/inhibitor/negative allosteric modulator, modulator (neither
   negative nor positive), inverse agonist, and mixed bioactivities
   (unknown or both agonist and antagonist). Only bioactivity data were
   used in the networks generated for this paper. The drug nodes are
   ordered by decreasing association with the phenotype in −log[10](P)
   units (from MAGMA pathway analysis). The target nodes are ordered by a
   score based on MAGMA results and S-PrediXcan results in the tissue
   family of interest (for more details see
   [76]https://drugtargetor.com/help.html). In Drug Targetor, the data
   entry for the new PGC MDD GWAS is encoded as “DEPR01”, and we chose the
   tissue family “Nervous System”.

Results

Gene-based tests of association

   We used MAGMA to map SNP-level association to individual genes, and
   annotated results based on druggability (cf. “Definition of the
   druggable genome”). A total of 211 genes achieved genome-wide
   significance (MAGMA P ≤ 2.62 × 10^−6, cf. Supplementary Tables
   [80]1–[81]3), of which 153 were located outside the major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. 24 of these 153 genes were
   annotated as druggable in the Finan et al. classification (Table
   [82]1). The MHC region was defined as the 25–35 Mb region on chromosome
   6.

   ^aBonferroni-significant

   To gain insight into the potential functional consequences of DNA
   sequence variation underlying MDD, we imputed gene expression using
   S-PrediXcan. Overall, 12 protein-coding genes outside the MHC were
   significantly up or downregulated in the brain or whole blood,
   (Supplementary Table [84]4). Among these genes, five were significant
   in the brain: NEGR1, LRFN5, KCL1, TMEM33 (upregulation), and SLC30A9
   (downregulation), and three were annotated as druggable: NEGR1, LRFN5,
   and ESR2. NEGR1 is positively associated with MDD in the putamen
   (Z = 7.06, P = 1.67 × 10^−12), LRFN5 in the cerebellum (Z = 5.21,
   P = 2.01 × 10^−11) and cerebellar hemisphere (Z = 5.23,
   P = 1.68 × 10^−7), whereas ESR2 is not significantly associated with
   MDD in the brain (cerebellum: Z = −1.73, P = 0.0843) but exhibits
   significant negative association in whole blood (Z = −5.43,
   P = 5.66 × 10^−8).

Drug classes and their drug-target networks

   We tested for the enrichment of MDD GWAS association signals within
   major therapeutic classes defined by ATC code, using the complete set
   of drug-gene interactions (“annotation” dataset) or only curated ChEMBL
   and PDSP bioactivities (“bioactivity” dataset). We used the Benjamini
   and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR)^[85]24 to correct for multiple
   testing whilst exploring more hypotheses (Fig. [86]2 and Supplementary
   Table [87]5). In the annotation dataset, 13 drug classes were
   significantly associated with MDD (FDR q-value < 0.05); in the more
   reliable bioactivity dataset, only five classes were identified as
   significant (Fig. [88]2). Both annotation and bioactivity datasets
   exhibited enrichment for psycholeptics (ATC code N05,
   P[bioactivity] = 9.81 × 10^−6), antipsychotics (N05A,
   P[bioactivity] = 1.71 × 10^−5), and sex hormones and modulators of the
   genital system (G03, P[bioactivity] = 5.75 × 10^−5). Non-selective
   monoamine reuptake inhibitors (N06AA, a subclass of antidepressants)
   were only significant in the bioactivity dataset
   (P[bioactivity] = 3.23 × 10^−3).

Fig. 2. Drug classes significantly enriched (FDR or Bonferroni) in major
depressive disorder when using the complete annotation set (“all drug-gene
connections”), or using only the curated bioactivity set (“curated
bioactivities”), which contains ChEMBL and PDSP Ki data.

   [89]Fig. 2
   [90]Open in a new tab

   The drug class enrichment was tested using Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon (MWW)
   rank tests, on drugs ordered by MAGMA pathway analysis p-value. The
   Bonferroni correction is based on the number of tested classes: 57 for
   the curated bioactivity set, 141 for the complete connection set

   Bipartite drug-target networks, which provide an insight into the mode
   of action for drugs and their putative targets, were built for each
   FDR-significant drug class (Supplementary Figures [91]1–[92]15). These
   networks provide a visual support for the drug class enrichment
   analysis, by highlighting the drug-target interactions driving the
   association between drugs in an enriched class and MDD—they also
   suggest in which tissues the genes might be up or downregulated and the
   potential negative or positive action of a drug. Phenotypic information
   from the human-mouse disease connection (HDMC) database for prioritized
   targets was also collected as supplementary information and provided in
   Table [93]2. Four patterns occur most often among
   Bonferroni-significant drug classes: dopamine receptor D2
   antagonism/agonism (DRD2), serotonin receptor 5-HT1D antagonism/agonism
   (HTR1D), calcium channels (CACNA2D1 and CACNA1H, CACNA1C being only
   FDR-significant) modulation and antagonism, and estrogen receptor ER-β
   (ESR2) modulation. Other patterns seen for FDR-significant drug classes
   include: cholinergic/acetylcholine receptor M3 antagonism (CHRM3),
   estrogen receptor ER-α (ESR1) modulation, GABA-A receptor agonism and
   antagonism (subunits encoded by GABRA1, GABRG3, GABRA6), histamine H1
   receptor antagonism (HRH1), and glutamate receptor 1 antagonism
   (GRIA1). A detailed description of druggable targets and their
   interactions is provided in Supplementary Text [94]2.

Potential repurposing candidates

   Top individual drugs from pathway analyses that have interaction with
   significant targets (Fig. [96]3) include calcium channel modulators or
   blockers (such as pregabalin, gabapentin, and nitrendipine), dopamine
   receptor D2 antagonists (alizapride, mesoridazine) or agonists
   (quinagolide), and hormonal medications such as levonorgestrel
   (inhibitory effect on sex hormone binding globulin) or
   diethylstilbestrol, an agonist of estrogen receptors. Gepirone is the
   only antidepressant in the top list and its association with MDD is
   driven by its dopamine D2 binding and 5-HT1A partial agonism. Other
   potentially more interesting candidates can be found by visualizing
   each enriched drug class in a bipartite drug-target interaction network
   (cf. Supplementary Figures [97]1–[98]15 and Discussion).

   using MAGMA pathway analysis, and the gene associations using MAGMA
   gene-wise analysis. Expression z-scores obtained by S-PrediXcan in the
   different tissues are colored in green for positive effect, red for
   negative effect. Drug/target connections are colored by drug action
   type

Discussion

   Most antidepressants are only partially effective and not all patients
   respond to these treatments, which also have frequent side effects that
   contribute to reduced treatment adherence^[102]25. Therefore, the
   antidepressant suitable for the individual patient is mostly chosen
   based on its efficacy and side effect profile in a strenuous and
   time-consuming process. Using the largest available GWAS, we conducted
   systematic analyses for associations of MDD with known drug targets and
   drug classes. We find that 13 drug classes based on the ATC
   classification are enriched for associations in the MDD GWAS data,
   among which are antidepressants, antipsychotics as well as sex hormones
   and antihistamines. We visualise and explore these drug classes using
   our online tool Drug Targetor ([103]drugtargetor.com), which displays
   bipartite drug-target networks for MDD that integrate genetic
   association and imputed gene expression information. The imputed gene
   expression data may indicate up or downregulation of genes in different
   tissues, thereby suggesting whether the effect of a gene or target
   should be inhibited or enhanced—for example, an antagonist could
   counteract the effect of an overexpressed target in the brain.

   We identified association patterns for MDD concentrated around key
   drug-target hubs, including calcium channels, dopamine, serotonin,
   histamine, and GABA receptors, as well as the predominantly female sex
   hormone estrogen. Many of the top druggable genes encode subunits of
   voltage-dependent calcium channels expressed in the brain (CACNA2D1,
   CACNA1H, CACNA1C), or are receptors of neurotransmitters and their
   subunits, such as GABA (GABRA1, GABRG3, GABRA6), acetylcholine (CHRM3),
   glutamate (GRIA1, GRM5, GRM8, GRIK5), serotonin (HTR1D), and dopamine
   (DRD2). These neurotransmitter receptors are targeted by many drugs
   included in the psycholeptics, psychoanaleptics, and anesthetics drug
   classes, many of which are already approved for the treatment of MDD.

   The enrichment of calcium channels confirms that calcium channel
   blockers such as verapamil may provide repurposing opportunities for
   MDD^[104]26, although their effects on blood pressure may prove
   problematic^[105]27. Pregabalin and gabapentin, both calcium channel
   modulators, are also top ranked repurposing candidates. Pregabalin has
   been shown to be an effective adjunctive treatment for MDD^[106]28 and
   treatment-resistant bipolar disorder^[107]29, and gabapentin is used
   off-label for bipolar disorder^[108]30. The side effect profile of
   gabapentin includes increased suicidality within the first week of
   treatment^[109]31, which is also seen with antidepressant use. The mood
   elevating effect of antidepressants is thought to occur after about 2–3
   weeks, lagging the increase in motivational behaviour, which could
   explain the higher risk for suicidal attempts^[110]32,[111]33. It may
   be that administration of calcium channel modulators over a longer time
   period could lead to a decrease of depressive symptoms after overcoming
   an initial ineffective episode.

   The association of histamine receptor H1 with MDD may indicate an
   involvement of the histaminergic system in MDD and depressive symptoms.
   Brompheniramine and chlorphenamine, which have very similar structures,
   are the top antihistamines associated with MDD. Interestingly,
   brompheniramine is the precursor of one of the first marketed
   antidepressant compounds, zimelidine, the first selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), patented in 1972^[112]34, although no longer
   in use due to its side effect profile^[113]35. These medications are
   first-generation antihistamines, which exhibit sedating effects of
   different intensities, which may help with disrupted sleep, a symptom
   common in MDD patients^[114]36.

   A female preponderance in MDD is well-established^[115]37,[116]38,
   making sex hormones interesting candidates for the treatment of MD. We
   saw associations between the estrogen receptors (ERs) ESR1 and ESR2 and
   MDD. This finding was further supported by a significant association of
   decreased whole-blood ESR2 expression and MDD, indicating that ER-β
   agonism could be possibly beneficial. However, no significant
   associations with altered expression levels in brain regions were
   found—which could be due to a lack of power. Lasofoxifene was a top
   ranked selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) identified in our
   drug-target networks. SERMs are hypothesised to function as
   neuroprotective and antiinflammatory agents in the central nervous
   system^[117]39 and the SERM raloxifene has been reported to decrease
   anxiety^[118]40 and depression^[119]41. Among sex hormones,
   levonorgestrel is one of our top repurposing candidates. The use of a
   levonorgestrel in intrauterine systems was associated with lower risk
   of postpartum depression^[120]42; however, another study showed
   increased risk of antidepressant use and first diagnosis of
   MDD^[121]43.

   Ketamine, a member of the drug class of anesthetics, is used off-label
   for depression via intravenous infusions^[122]44,[123]45; our results
   suggest that its D2 partial agonism might be one possible explanation
   for its antidepressant effect, together with its serotonin and
   glutamate receptor antagonism^[124]46 and interaction with other
   neurotransmitter systems^[125]47. In our analyses of druggable genes,
   the dopamine receptor 2 (D2) gene (DRD2) is clearly associated with
   MDD. In addition, antipsychotics as well as antidepressants targeting
   D2 are usually antagonists; antipsychotics are used as augmentation
   therapies in patients with MDD if initial antidepressant therapies do
   not result in remission of symptoms^[126]48. However, we note that
   mesoridazine, a neuroleptic and D2 antagonist in our top list for
   repurposing opportunities, was withdrawn from the US market due to
   major side effects^[127]49.

   Our analyses suggest that HTR1D overexpression is associated with MDD
   in six brain regions (although none of these associations is
   significant). HTR1D overexpression could either be leading to
   depressive symptoms, suggesting that 5-HT1D antagonism could counteract
   them, or could be a compensatory mechanism due to low serotonin levels,
   suggesting a beneficial effect of 5-HT1D agonists on depressive
   symptoms. The first hypothesis is supported by the 5-HT1D antagonist
   activity displayed by vortioxetine, an antidepressant and serotonin
   modulator^[128]50.

   These results, while interesting, have considerable caveats.
   Specifically, a key point when using GWAS data is the direction of
   effect. The relationship between a drug and a phenotype cannot easily
   be inferred; an association may reflect either a depression-inducing
   effect or an antidepressant effect. We partially address this issue via
   imputation and prediction of gene expression, but pharmacological,
   molecular and clinical validation will be needed before drawing
   definitive conclusions. However, we suggest that our findings may
   represent a source of new therapeutic hypotheses for MDD—a common and
   currently only partially treatable disorder.
