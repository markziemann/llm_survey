Abstract

   Catharanthus roseus is a medicinal plant, which can produce monoterpene
   indole alkaloid (MIA) metabolites with biological activity and is rich
   in vinblastine and vincristine. With release of the scaffolded genome
   sequence of C. roseus, it is necessary to annotate gene functions on
   the whole-genome level. Recently, 53 RNA-seq datasets are available in
   public with different tissues (flower, root, leaf, seedling, and shoot)
   and different treatments (MeJA, PnWB infection and yeast elicitor). We
   used in-house data process pipeline with the combination of PCC and MR
   algorithms to construct a co-expression network exploring
   multi-dimensional gene expression (global, tissue preferential, and
   treat response) through multi-layered approaches. In the meanwhile, we
   added miRNA-target pairs, predicted PPI pairs into the network and
   provided several tools such as gene set enrichment analysis, functional
   module enrichment analysis, and motif analysis for functional
   prediction of the co-expression genes. Finally, we have constructed an
   online croFGD database ([32]http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/croFGD/).
   We hope croFGD can help the communities to study the C. roseus
   functional genomics and make novel discoveries about key genes involved
   in some important biological processes.

Introduction

   Catharanthus roseus, a model plant of the Apocynaceae family, is best
   known for production of the bis-indole monoterpene indole alkaloids
   (MIAs). There are four important MIAs, vinblastine and vincristine used
   in the clinic as anti-cancer agents ([33]Aslam et al., 2010),
   catharanthine which can reduce blood sugar content ([34]Pan et al.,
   2012), and vindoline. MIAs belong to a class of terpenoid indole
   alkaloids (TIAs). Some TIAs exhibit strong pharmacological activities,
   whose production has beneficial effects on human health ([35]Almagro et
   al., 2015). The biosynthesis of TIAs is regulated by several key
   transcription factors (TFs), such as ORCA3, ORCA2, WRKY, MYC, ZCT1, and
   BIS, which can enhance alkaloid production ([36]Van Der Fits and
   Memelink, 2000; [37]Suttipanta et al., 2011; [38]Zhang et al., 2011;
   [39]Li et al., 2013; [40]Van Moerkercke et al., 2015; [41]Rizvi et al.,
   2016). In addition to these key TFs, some hormones and transporters are
   essential for the regulation of TIA biosynthesis in C. roseus ([42]Liu
   et al., 2017). Some external signals such as elicitor and jasmonate
   (JA) can regulate the activities of several TFs involved in TIA
   biosynthesis ([43]Memelink and Gantet, 2007). Although much progress
   has been made in the field of TIAs, functions of some key genes and
   enzymes associated with the regulation of TIA biosynthesis are still
   unknown, which makes it difficult to understand the whole process.
   Notably, the release of the scaffolded genome sequence of C. roseus
   ([44]Kellner et al., 2015), makes it possible to refine functional
   annotations of genes by integrating multidimensional data and existing
   methods.

   The integration of biological information through gene expression
   profiling analysis can benefit to elucidating gene function
   ([45]Noordewier and Warren, 2001). Transcriptomic datasets can be used
   to establish the gene expression profiles, which can provide some
   useful information for inferring gene regulatory relationship
   ([46]Newton and Wernisch, 2014). Transcriptome analysis reveals that
   some genes involved in TIA biosynthesis are differentially expressed in
   leaf and root tissues, which can help understand specialized metabolic
   pathways in C. roseus ([47]Verma et al., 2014). Integrated
   transcriptome and metabolome analysis can establish connections between
   genes and specialized metabolites, which can identify many genes
   involved in TIA synthesis and elucidate particular biological pathways
   ([48]Rischer et al., 2006). Basing on transcriptomic datasets, the
   network construction can provide important biological knowledge,
   especially for digging out possible gene functions ([49]Rhee and
   Mutwil, 2014).

   Currently, there has been a plenty of transcriptomic datasets available
   on the public platform, which lay the foundation for the research in C.
   roseus. By considering all collected transcriptomic samples available
   together, co-expression network is applied to predicting gene functions
   on a large scale ([50]Ma et al., 2014). Co-expression network analysis
   can mimic some important regulatory mechanism in vivo and thus discover
   key regulatory genes or functional modules. [51]van Dam et al. (2017)
   excavated disease-related functional modules and annotated core genes
   based on co-expression network analysis. Considering that genes within
   a specialized metabolite pathway may form tight associations with each
   other in co-expression network, the method for connecting genes to
   specialized metabolic pathways in plant is effective, which can
   identify novel genes associated with specialized metabolic pathways
   ([52]Wisecaver et al., 2017). Co-expression network analysis identified
   two missing enzymes, PAS and DPAS, necessary for vinblastine
   biosynthesis in C. roseus, which is important for understanding many
   other bioactive alkaloids ([53]Caputi et al., 2018).

   A growing number of studies have supported the utility of co-expression
   network analysis for inferring and annotating gene function, and
   excavating core genes involved in specific biological process. PlaNet
   used Heuristic Cluster Chiseling Algorithm (HCCA) to construct
   whole-genome co-expression networks for Arabidopsis and six important
   plant crop species ([54]Mutwil et al., 2011). AraNet presented
   co-functional gene network for Arabidopsis and generated functional
   predictions for 27 non-model plant species using an orthologous-based
   projection ([55]Lee et al., 2015). ATTED-II provided 16 co-expression
   platforms for nine plant species through combining the Pearson
   correlation coefficient (PCC) and mutual rank (MR) algorithm ([56]Aoki
   et al., 2016). Our lab have published several functional genomics
   databases with co-expression network for plant species ([57]Yu et al.,
   2014; [58]You et al., 2015, [59]2016; [60]Zhang et al., 2015; [61]Tian
   et al., 2016; [62]Ma et al., 2018). Besides, ccNET provided comparative
   gene functional analyses at a multi-dimensional network and epigenome
   level across diploid and polyploid Gossypium species based on the
   co-expression network ([63]You et al., 2017). With the combination of
   transcriptomic and epigenomic data, MCENet provided global and
   conditional networks to help identify maize functional genes or modules
   associated with agronomic traits ([64]Tian et al., 2018).

   Here, we constructed a functional genomics database for C. roseus
   (croFGD). It provided three types of co-expression network, which
   allowed user to perform network search and analysis from a
   multi-dimensional perspective. Functional annotation information and
   several analysis tools were provided for functional prediction of the
   co-expression genes. Basing on co-expression network, we identified
   some functional modules which could be applied to the discovery of
   vital genes associated with agronomic traits. The integration of
   co-expression network analysis and functional module identification can
   be used to improve C. roseus gene function annotation and helpful for
   the functional genomics research. Besides, it can promote the research
   for the synthesis, metabolism of active substances and drug
   development.

Materials and Methods

Transcriptomic Data Source

   There were 53 samples in Catharanthus roseus collected from the NCBI
   Sequence Read Archive (SRA), which covered different tissues (root,
   hairy root, shoot, stem, leaf, flower, seedling, and callus) and
   different treatments, such as methyl jasmonate (MeJA), peanut witches’
   broom (PnWB) infection and yeast elicitor ([65]Supplementary Table S1).

Data Processing and Gene Expression Profiling Analysis

   The C. roseus genome had a size of ∼500 Mb, and 33,829 protein-coding
   genes. All transcriptomic datasets were subjected to quality control
   using FastQC software (v0.10.1) ([66]Brown et al., 2017). Those
   datasets with mapping rate <50% were filtered out. The sequence reads
   were mapped to the C. roseus reference genome (ASM94934v1) ([67]Kellner
   et al., 2015) using Tophat (v2.0.10) software ([68]Trapnell et al.,
   2009) with default parameters. Cufflinks (v2.2.1) ([69]Trapnell et al.,
   2010) was used to calculate the FPKM (fragments per kilobase of
   transcript per million mapped reads) values with default parameters.
   And differentially expressed genes was calculated by Cuffdiff (v2.2.1)
   ([70]Trapnell et al., 2013).

Co-expression Network Construction

   Pearson correlation coefficient is used to calculate correlation
   coefficient between two genes. MR represents high credible
   co-expression gene pairs after ranking the PCC. PCC is calculated based
   on the formula below. The more similar the expression pattern in
   samples between genes is, the higher the PCC score might be. MR is an
   algorithm basing on PCC, which takes a geometric average of the PCC
   rank from gene A to gene B and from gene B to gene A.

   X or Y represents the FPKM value, and n represents the number of
   samples. MR ensures those co-expression gene pairs with low credibility
   will be filtered out, so the PCC and MR are combined to construct
   co-expression network. Here, all samples were used for the construction
   of global co-expression network. Among all samples, 44 samples without
   treatment were used to construct tissue-preferential network, and 32
   samples with treatment and corresponding control were used to construct
   the treat-response network.

Functional Module Identification and Parameter Selection

   The Clique Percolation Method (CPM) ([71]Adamcsek et al., 2006) was
   used to identify modules with nodes densely connected to each other in
   three types of co-expression networks, including global network,
   tissue-preferential network and treat-response network. Parameter
   selection was based on module number, module overlap rate and gene
   coverage rate. Here, we selected the k = 5 clique size for global
   co-expression network, which meant each module had at least five nodes
   and each node had co-expression relationship with each other
   ([72]Supplementary Figure S2). In fact, one functional module could be
   regarded as a small network. Similarly, we selected the k = 6 clique
   size for tissue-preferential network and treat-response network. The
   functions of the modules were annotated through gene set enrichment
   analysis (GSEA) ([73]Yi et al., 2013), including GO terms, gene
   families, plantCyc and KEGG pathways.

The Identification of Orthologous Genes in Arabidopsis

   Bidirectional blast alignments were conducted for the analysis of
   protein sequences between C. roseus and Arabidopsis. Our criteria for
   the identification of orthologous gene pairs were as follows: the top
   three hits in each bidirectional blast alignment were selected as the
   best orthologous pairs; in addition, orthologous pairs with an e-value
   less than 1E-25 were regarded as the second level.

The Classification of Gene Family

   Five main gene families, including TFs and regulator factors (TRs),
   carbohydrate-active enzymes, kinase, ubiquitin and cytochrome P450,
   were classified to improve limited functional annotation. TF/TRs and
   kinase family were identified mainly by iTAK tool ([74]Zheng et al.,
   2016) based on the rule in PlnTFDB ([75]Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2009)
   and PlantsP Kinase Classification ([76]Tchieu et al., 2003),
   respectively. The carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) family
   ([77]Lombard et al., 2014) was predicted through the method of
   orthologous search based on Arabidopsis thaliana. The enzymes were
   classified into six groups: glycoside hydrolases (GH),
   glycosyltransferase (GT), polysaccharide lyases (PL), carbohydrate
   esterase (CE), auxiliary activities (AA) and carbohydrate-binding
   modules (CBM). Ubiquitin family was identified through Hidden Markov
   Model (HMM) search based on models from UUCD ([78]Gao et al., 2013).
   And cytochrome P450 family was predicted by orthologous relationship
   with Arabidopsis and the candidates were confirmed with ID of PF00067
   by Pfam ([79]Finn et al., 2014) search.

Z-Score for Motif Analysis

   Motif (cis-element) analysis tool is developed to identify significant
   motifs in one sequence or in the promoter region of interested gene
   list and thus predict possible functions. Z-score is a statistical
   measurement of the distance in standard deviations of a sample, which
   can act as a normalization method to eliminate the difference caused by
   background for different samples. So far, it is widely applied to
   calculating the cis-element significance ([80]Endo et al., 2014).

   The Z-score is calculated as:

   represents mean value of the same motif in 1,000 random gene lists with
   same scale. σ represents standard deviation of the 1,000 mean value
   based on random selection.

Plant Materials and Growth Conditions

   C. roseus seeds were planted in small pots and kept moistened until the
   seeds had germinated, and allowed to grow until they had three to five
   leaves, then transferred to a greenhouse (16 h light/8 h darkness,
   28/25°C). For MeJA treatment, 100 μM MeJA was sprayed evenly on leaves
   and stem of well-growth plants. In order to prevent MeJA decomposition,
   leaves and stem with treatment and corresponding control were under
   darkness. After treatment for 6 and 24 h, the leaves and stem were
   harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at
   -80°C for use. Control samples were also harvested. Three biologically
   repeated samples were harvested.

RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR

   About 100 mg of tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen before isolation
   of the RNA. Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL^® reagent (Invitrogen,
   Carlsbad, CA, United States) and purified using Qiagen RNeasy columns
   (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription was performed using
   Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV; Invitrogen). We heated 10 μL
   samples containing 2 μg of total RNA, and 20 pmol of random hexamers
   (Invitrogen) at 70°C for 2 min to denature the RNA and then chilled the
   samples on ice for 2 min. We added reaction buffer and M-MLV to a total
   volume of 20 μL containing 500 μM dNTPs, 50 mM Tris-HCl (PH 8.3), 75 mM
   KCl, 3 mM MgCl[2], 5 mM dithiothreitol, 200 units of M-MLV and 20 pmol
   random hexamers. The samples were then heated at 42°C for 1.5 h. The
   cDNA samples were diluted to 2 ng/μL for real time RT-PCR analysis.

   For quantitative real-time RT-PCR, triplicate quantitative assays were
   performed on 1 μL of each cDNA dilution using the SYBR Green Master Mix
   with an ABI 7900 sequence detection system according to the
   manufacture’s protocol (Applied Biosystems). The gene-specific primers
   were designed using PRIMER3^[81]1. The amplification of 18S rRNA was
   used as an internal control to normalize all data (forward primer,
   5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGTCACTACCT
   CCCCGTGTCA-3′). Gene-specific primers were listed in [82]Supplementary
   Table S2. The relative quantification method (ΔΔCT) was used to
   evaluate quantitative variation between replicates examined.

Construction and Content

Database Construction

   The database was constructed under the LAMP (Linux + Apache + Mysql +
   PHP) environment. It mainly contains three parts: (I) functional
   annotation, which includes gene family, KEGG pathway and miRNA detailed
   information, etc.; (II) network and module, including co-expression
   network search and analysis, network comparison and module search;
   (III) some analysis tools, mainly including cis-element enrichment
   analysis, GSEA, functional module enrichment analysis and UCSC Genome
   Browser visualization ([83]Figure 1).

   Database architecture. The croFGD database is divided into three main
   pieces: network & module, functional annotation, and analysis tools.
   The line with different colors indicates different pieces.

Functional Annotation

   We obtained the functional annotation information in C. roseus from the
   Dryad Digital Repository ([85]Kellner et al., 2015). Among 33,829
   protein-coding genes, 14,527 genes were annotated with 4,734 GO terms
   by blast2GO ([86]Conesa and Gotz, 2008). 5,571 enzymes involved in 213
   metabolism pathways were annotated by GhostKOALA ([87]Kanehisa et al.,
   2016) from KEGG database. We mapped C. roseus protein sequences against
   CathaCyc ([88]Van Moerkercke et al., 2013) using the BLASTP program and
   2,421 enzymes involved in 513 metabolism pathways were annotated. Then
   we predicted 36,882 orthologous pairs between C. roseus and Arabidopsis
   through bidirectional blast alignment. There were a total of 1,035
   plant motifs collected from the Plant Cis-acting Regulatory DNA
   Elements (PLACE) database ([89]Higo et al., 1999), PlantCARE database
   ([90]Rombauts et al., 1999), AthaMap database ([91]Steffens, 2004) and
   literatures. Furthermore, we adopted the inparanoid algorithm
   ([92]Sonnhammer and Östlund, 2015) and predicted 9,377 protein–protein
   interaction (PPI) pairs in C. roseus from over 18,000 experimentally
   validated PPI pairs in Arabidopsis integrated from several databases,
   such as BIOGRID ([93]Chatr-Aryamontri et al., 2017), IntAct
   ([94]Orchard et al., 2014) and related literature ([95]Lumba et al.,
   2014). We also collected 227 miRNA sequence information derived from a
   literature ([96]Shen et al., 2017), and then mapped these miRNA
   sequences against the whole-genome sequence using the GMAP program
   ([97]Wu and Watanabe, 2005). Furthermore, 143 miRNA targets were
   identified by psRNATarget ([98]Dai and Zhao, 2011). The miRNA detailed
   information mainly included location, sequence and structure, miRNA
   target and expression profiles in seedling after MeJA treatment
   ([99]Supplementary Figure S3). Furthermore, we conducted the gene
   family classification and finally predicted 88 TFs/TRs families with
   1,702 genes, 21 ubiquitin families with 1,192 genes, 98 cytochrome P450
   families with 191 genes, 85 kinase families with 778 genes and 96 CAZy
   families with 1,505 genes ([100]Table 1).

Co-expression Network and Functional Module

   A well-developed strategy with the integration of PCC and MR algorithm
   was widely applied to the construction of co-expression network
   ([112]You et al., 2016, [113]2017; [114]Obayashi et al., 2018;
   [115]Tian et al., 2018). We used the 240 BP terms of GO associated with
   >4 and <20 genes to evaluate the networks. To get optimal gene pairs
   and evaluate the credibility of co-expression network, we selected
   different PCC thresholds of PCC > 0.7, PCC > 0.8, PCC > 0.9 and
   different MR thresholds of MR top3 + MR ≤ 30, MR top3 + MR ≤ 50, MR
   top3 + MR ≤ 100 to predict gene functions basing on selected GO terms
   and generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
   ([116]Supplementary Figure S1). The larger the area under the curve
   (AUC) value of co-expression network is, the higher the credibility of
   the network will be. Finally, we selected the thresholds of PCC > 0.7
   and MR top3 + MR ≤ 30 to filter out those co-expression gene pairs with
   low credibility to construct co-expression network. In total, there
   were 30,096, 29,808 and 30,541 nodes in global network,
   tissue-preferential network and treat-response network with gene
   expression view, which covered 88.9%, 88.1%, and 90.3% of genes in C.
   roseus, respectively ([117]Table 1). All networks were visualized by
   Cytoscape 2.8 ([118]Smoot et al., 2011).

   Then we overlaid the gene expression value onto the co-expression
   network to identify whether genes in the network were expressed or not
   based on the minimum threshold FPKM value. To determine the minimum
   threshold of the gene expression value (FPKM) among all C. roseus
   samples (detailed mapping results are shown in [119]Supplementary Table
   S3), the lowest 5% of all gene FPKM values in each sample and the
   standard deviation (SD) of each experimental group were computed. The
   mathematical formula “threshold = average (5% value) + 3 ^∗ SD”
   ([120]You et al., 2016, [121]2017) was used to calculate the minimum
   expression value of each experimental group. The minimum threshold of
   FPKM was 0.094. We identified differential expressed genes between
   treatment and control samples by the cutoff: |log[2]FC|≥ 1 and p-value
   ≤ 0.05. Tissue-preferential analysis in different tissues (root, hairy
   root, shoot, stem, leaf, flower, seedling, and callus) and
   treat-response analysis under three types of treatments (MeJA, PnWB
   infection and yeast elicitor) among five tissues (root, shoot, flower,
   callus, and hairy root) were supplied for the co-expression network
   analysis. Meanwhile, predicted miRNA target and PPI pairs were
   integrated into the network, and further analysis was provided for all
   members in the network, such as gene expression profiling analysis,
   GSEA, and cis-element analysis.

   Furthermore, co-expression network could be used to perform modularized
   analysis and excavation for the discovery of agronomic trait-related
   vital gene and functional module. The CPM proposed to detect the
   overlapping communities in the complex network ([122]Palla et al.,
   2005; [123]Li et al., 2014), provided certain practicability for the
   discovery of key gene and module. Finally, we applied the algorithm and
   predicted 2,310, 1,849, and 2,177 functional modules in global network,
   tissue-preferential network and treat-response network in C. roseus,
   respectively ([124]Table 1). The functions of these modules were
   annotated through GSEA ([125]Yi et al., 2013). The entries which were
   not significant were filtered out by Fisher’s tests and multiple test
   correction method (FDR ≤ 0.05). These functional modules covered
   diverse functions such as vindoline and vinblastine biosynthesis,
   jasmonic acid biosynthesis, pathogen resistance and hormone response,
   etc.

Analysis Tools

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

   Gene set enrichment analysis ([126]Yi et al., 2013) is a powerful
   method for the functional annotation of interested gene list by
   computing the overlaps with well-defined background gene sets. Some
   categories of gene sets, such as GO terms, gene families, plantCyc and
   KEGG pathways, miRNA targets and functional modules identified from
   three types of network, were used as background gene sets. The
   significantly enriched gene set with FDRs ≤ 0.05 would be displayed on
   the GSEA result page.

Functional Module Enrichment Analysis

   The tool was used to identify some functional modules from interested
   gene list especially in the network. The previously annotated miRNA
   target modules and functional modules identified from three types of
   network were used as background functional modules. The modules with
   FDRs ≤ 0.05 would be regarded as significantly enriched and the
   enrichment analysis result page included module annotation, module
   source, overlap gene number, and FDR value.

Cis-Element Enrichment Analysis

   Cis-element (motif), a short conserved sequence, can be recognized by
   some TFs to regulate the expression levels of downstream genes. The
   tool was developed to identify motifs in a set of gene promoters and
   thus predict the function of gene set. The cis-element significance
   test is an algorithm using statistical method based on Z-score and
   p-value filtering ([127]Yu et al., 2014) that can identify significant
   cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region of one gene. The
   promoter region was set as 3 kb in C. roseus. When scanned in the 3 kb
   promoter region of C. roseus genes, motifs with p-value ≤ 0.05 were
   significantly enriched on account of the frequency of motif occurrence.

Other Tools Supported in croFGD

   A quick search, UCSC Genome Browser ([128]Speir et al., 2016)
   visualization and a manual were provided for users. The search page
   mainly included gene detail search, gene function search, functional
   module search and orthologous search. The orthologous search allowed
   user to input one gene list in Arabidopsis to search for corresponding
   C. roseus genes.

Function Application

Comprehensive Exploration for the Function of 16OMT Gene

   CRO_T004356 (16OMT), o-methyltransferase family member, which was
   reported to be involved in the biosynthesis of TIAs ([129]Pandey et
   al., 2016; [130]Yamamoto et al., 2016). Taking 16OMT gene as an
   example, we explored possible function of the gene through the
   database. By gene detail search, we found that the gene: (I) was
   annotated with alkaloid biosynthetic process (GO: 0009821) and
   myricetin 3′-O-methyltransferase activity (GO: 0033799), etc.; (II) had
   two pfam domains: “Dimerisation (PF08100)” and “Methyltransf_2
   (PF00891)” domains; (III) was mainly involved in vindoline and
   vinblastine biosynthesis; (IV) was relatively high in expression in
   leaf tissue ([131]Figure 2A). We conducted network analysis for three
   types of co-expression network of 16OMT gene including
   tissue-preferential network ([132]Figure 2B), global network
   ([133]Figure 2C) and treat-response network ([134]Figure 2D). GSEA
   results for global network genes indicated that these genes might be
   involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, vindoline and vinblastine
   biosynthesis. Network comparison results suggested that it was
   relatively conservative between global network and tissue-preferential
   network ([135]Figure 2E), and there were great differences between
   global network and treat-response network ([136]Figure 2F). Through
   module search, the gene in the module ([137]Figure 2G) might be
   involved in vindoline and vinblastine biosynthesis, alkaloid
   biosynthetic process, and protein phosphorylation, etc. Therefore,
   16OMT gene might have diverse function in several biological processes
   like hos1 gene ([138]MacGregor and Penfield, 2015). The expression
   heatmaps of all genes in the module were included ([139]Figure 2H).
   UCSC genome browser visualization ([140]Figure 2I) indicated that most
   RNA-seq peaks were enriched in the genic region. Furthermore,
   stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis pathway was
   shown ([141]Figure 2J).

Co-expression Network Analysis for CPR Gene

   CPR, NADPH–cytochrome P450 reductase, which is essential for the
   activation of cytochrome P450 enzymes, is critical for the biosynthesis
   of MIAs ([143]Parage et al., 2016). The detailed information of all
   genes in the global network of CPR gene ([144]Figure 3A) was listed in
   [145]Supplementary Table S4. In the CPR network, some genes (GES, 7DLH,
   GOR, HDS, G8H, ISY, MCS, HDR, 7DLGT and IO) were involved in MIA
   biosynthesis pathway ([146]Chebbi et al., 2014; [147]Kumar et al.,
   2015). These genes were labeled with bold in the MIA biosynthesis
   pathway ([148]Figure 3C). Through GO enrichment analysis ([149]Tian et
   al., 2017) for all genes in the CPR network, the significantly enriched
   GO terms were associated with terpene biosynthetic process, and
   isoprenoid biosynthetic process ([150]Figure 3B), which were related to
   MIA biosynthesis ([151]Geu-Flores et al., 2012; [152]Dugé de
   Bernonville et al., 2015). Through module enrichment analysis for all
   genes in CPR network, three genes (CYP76C, CRO_T015823, and
   CRO_T014922) in significantly enriched functional modules might be
   involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis, gibberellic acid (GA)
   response and indole alkaloid biosynthesis, respectively ([153]Figure
   3D). Therefore, in addition to MIA biosynthesis, CYP76C and CRO_T015823
   also played important role in plant growth and development. Besides,
   CRO_T014922 might also be involved in MIA biosynthesis together with
   other genes (CRO_T019924, CRO_T030883, CRO_T015465, and CRO_T025273) in
   the module ([154]Figure 3D). Thus, in addition to the function of
   network, co-expressed genes might be involved in some other functions.
   Furthermore, co-expression analysis can be combined with module
   enrichment analysis to predict gene function effectively.

Network Comparison Between Global Network and Tissue-Preferential Network of
JAZ1 Gene

   JAZ1, a jasmonate-zim-domain protein, was discovered as repressors of
   jasmonate signaling, which was involved in TIA biosynthesis ([156]Pan
   et al., 2018). We conducted network comparison between global network
   and tissue-preferential network of JAZ1 ([157]Figure 4A). The
   information of co-expressed genes in global network and
   tissue-preferential network was shown in [158]Supplementary Table S5.
   We found that the two networks displayed different network structure.
   There were nine overlapped genes including JAZ1 gene between two
   networks. Fifteen unique genes (including TIFY, CYP94C, and JAZ3)
   appeared in global network, while sixteen unique genes including MYB15
   appeared in tissue-preferential network. GSEA results for the genes in
   global network of JAZ1 indicated that some gene sets were significantly
   enriched, such as jasmonic acid biosynthesis, alpha-linolenic acid
   metabolism, steroid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction
   ([159]Menke et al., 1999; [160]Koo et al., 2014; [161]Patra et al.,
   2018). GSEA results for the genes in tissue-preferential network of
   JAZ1 illustrated that some gene sets were significantly enriched, such
   as jasmonic acid biosynthetic process, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase
   activity, NADPH dehydrogenase activity, triglyceride lipase activity
   and oxylipin biosynthetic process ([162]Figure 4B) ([163]Tani et al.,
   2008; [164]Wallström et al., 2014; [165]Wang et al., 2018). Based on
   the structure and function of the two networks of JAZ1 gene, there were
   some conservation and differences between two networks. In Arabidopsis,
   cytochrome p450 family member CYP94C1 and CYP94B3 played important role
   in the regulation of jasmonate response ([166]Niu et al., 2011;
   [167]Heitz et al., 2012; [168]Koo et al., 2014). In Gossypium hirsutum,
   GhJAZ2 regulated the jasmonic acid signaling pathway by interacting
   with the R2R3-MYB transcription factor GhMYB25 ([169]Hu et al., 2016).
   It needed further study whether the two genes CYP94C and MYB15
   coexpressed with JAZ1 in two networks had similar function in C. roseus
   as in Arabidopsis and Gossypium hirsutum, respectively. These results
   indicated that network comparison is an effective approach to analyze
   gene function from the perspective of different networks.

Treat-Response Network With Expression View After MeJA Treatment

   In JAZ1 network with expression view after MeJA treatment in different
   tissues (shoot, root, hairy root, and seedling) ([171]Figure 5), most
   genes had significant change in expression, such as JAZ1, JAZ3, CYP94C,
   MYB, MYB15, and TIFY. Detailed information for up and down-regulated
   genes in these networks was shown ([172]Supplementary Table S6). In C.
   roseus, JAZ proteins could repress MYC2 and BIS1 to respond to JA
   signaling and then modulate MIA biosynthesis ([173]Patra et al., 2018).
   In rice, enhanced expression of cytochrome p450 family member CYP94C2b
   could alleviate the jasmonate response and enhanced salt tolerance
   ([174]Kurotani et al., 2015). In Arabidopsis, AtMYB44 could repress
   JA-mediated defense by activating the expression of WRKY70 at
   transcriptional level ([175]Shim et al., 2013). PvTIFY10C and GsTIFY10
   gene acted as a repressor in the JA signaling pathway in Phaseolus
   vulgaris and Glycine soja ([176]Zhu et al., 2011; [177]Aparicio-Fabre
   et al., 2013), respectively. We conferred that CYP94C, MYB, MYB15, and
   TIFY co-expressed with JAZ1 might act as JA-response candidate genes in
   C. roseus. Furthermore, CRO_T012104 (anthranilate synthase beta
   subunit), CRO_T013473 (protein of unknown function), CRO_T010878
   (alpha/beta-hydrolases superfamily protein), CRO_T002729 (allene oxide
   cyclase), and CRO_T002624 (tryptophan biosynthesis) almost up-regulated
   under those five conditions, might also act as JA-response candidate
   genes. Taking treat-response network of JAZ1 gene as an example, we
   selected six genes (JAZ1, TIFY, MYB, CRO_T012104, CRO_T024124, and
   CRO_T002729) for the real time RT-PCR validation ([178]Supplementary
   Figure S4). These genes were up-regulated after MeJA treatment in shoot
   tissues and might act as JA-response genes. The qRT-PCR results
   indicated that these genes acted as JA-response genes in shoot tissues.
   This not only validated the accuracy of the predicted results, but also
   demonstrated the reliability of the network. Thus, treat-response
   network with expression view can clear display the dynamic change of
   gene expression in a network. Therefore, the co-expression network with
   multi-dimensional analysis can benefit to analyzing regulatory
   mechanisms in C. roseus development and stress response.

Discussion

   Our croFGD database aims to provide an online database server for the
   annotation and prediction of gene function. We constructed global
   network, tissue-preferential network and treat-response network with
   expression view, which covered almost 90% of gene in C. roseus and
   identified more than 6,000 functional modules. The annotation of these
   functional modules covered vindoline and vinblastine biosynthesis,
   jasmonic acid biosynthesis, hormone response and pathogen resistance,
   etc. The network analysis strategy, functional module annotation and
   integrated method could improve and refine gene function annotation
   from diverse perspectives to some extent. For some crops, it could be
   applied to excavate important functional module related to agronomic
   traits, which would be beneficial for genetic breeding.

   Through some analysis tools supported in croFGD, we can excavate key
   genes involved in some important biological processes and predict gene
   function. In comprehensive exploration for the function of 16OMT
   ([180]Figure 2), we found that the gene might have complex function,
   like hos1 gene ([181]MacGregor and Penfield, 2015). In global network
   of CPR, some genes were involved in MIA biosynthesis, such as GES,
   7DLH, GOR, G8H, ISY, and 7DLGT ([182]Figure 3A). The integration of
   co-expression network analysis and module enrichment analysis can be
   benefit to predicting gene function effectively and refining gene
   annotation. Basing on network comparison between two networks of JAZ1,
   there were certain similarities and differences whether in the
   structure or in the function of two networks ([183]Figure 4). In
   addition, function of two genes CYP94C and MYB15 needed further
   research. In treat-response network of JAZ1 gene with expression view
   after MeJA treatment in different tissues, we identified several
   possible JA-response candidate genes ([184]Figure 5 and
   [185]Supplementary Table S6), which was experimentally validated by
   real time RT-PCR ([186]Supplementary Figure S4). These results would be
   beneficial to understanding some molecular regulatory mechanisms in C.
   roseus, such as MIA biosynthesis and jasmonic acid biosynthesis, etc.

   Comparative co-expression network analysis between species is an
   effective approach to predict gene function and improve functional
   annotation ([187]Pathania et al., 2016). We conducted network
   comparison for gene list with PCC ranks in the top 300 between C.
   roseus and Arabidopsis (obtained from ATTED-II) ([188]Supplementary
   Figure S5). High similarity between co-expression network of JAZ1 in C.
   roseus and AT1G19180 (JAZ1) in Arabidopsis not only demonstrated the
   reliability of co-expression network, but also illustrated the
   conservation of JAZ1 gene function between these two species.

   Based on co-expression network with multi-dimensional level, predicting
   functional module and refining gene function is an effective strategy,
   which can be used to identify more key genes and regulatory modules
   when we focus on a detailed biological process. Interestingly,
   co-expression network is highly associated with the regulation of
   epigenetic modification, such as DNA methylation ([189]El-Sharkawy et
   al., 2015) and H3K4me3 ([190]Farris et al., 2015), which can be
   integrated to understand detailed molecular mechanism, such as the
   biosynthesis of specific metabolites. There is a certain correlation
   between co-expression network and metabolic network, the integration of
   which can be used to predict key enzyme-coding genes and metabolites
   ([191]Chen et al., 2013), and contribute to better understanding of the
   molecular mechanisms related to plant metabolic pathway ([192]Rischer
   et al., 2006; [193]Coneva et al., 2014).

   Notably, there are additional limitations and possible improvements for
   croFGD database. Firstly, the release of the chromosome-level genome of
   C. roseus in the future, will greatly promote the research on
   functional genomics. Secondly, more RNA-seq samples of other tissues
   and treatments could be integrated into the co-expression network
   construction on the transcriptomic level, which will be beneficial to
   excavate gene function and improve the whole genome annotation in C.
   roseus. Thirdly, epigenomic data, such as ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data,
   can be integrated to improve the annotation of cis-elements and predict
   gene function. Furthermore, more accurate data, such as gene families,
   new type of non-coding RNAs, KEGG pathway and GO terms, needs to be
   integrated, too. Our croFGD database will be updated regularly, and we
   hope the database can help the community study the functional genomics
   and yield novel insights into the molecular regulatory mechanisms.
