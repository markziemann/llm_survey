Here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis details from the provided text, formatted for a table.

**1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**

MAGMA (Molecular Gene-set Analysis of GWAS) was used for pathway enrichment analysis.

**2. Was a tool version number provided?**

Yes, MAGMA v1.2.3 was used.

**3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**

Multiple gene set libraries were queried, including:

*   Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes
*   KEGG pathways
*   Reactome pathways

**4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**

Yes, a background gene list was defined as all genes with a valid SNP in the GWAS data.

**5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**

A competitive gene set test was used, which takes into account the total number of SNPs tested.

**6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**

Yes, false discovery rate (FDR) correction was used with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control for multiple testing.
