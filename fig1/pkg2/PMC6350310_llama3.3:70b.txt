Here are the answers to the questions about pathway enrichment analysis:

1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?
 Not described.

2. Was a tool version number provided?
 Not described.

3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?
 Gene ontology term enrichments were mentioned in the article, suggesting that the Gene Ontology (GO) library may have been used, but this is not explicitly stated as being part of a pathway enrichment analysis.

4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?
 Not described.

5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?
 Not described.

6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?
 Not described, but p-values are mentioned as being provided in Additional file 2, and − Log p values are mentioned as being considered for biomarker candidates.
