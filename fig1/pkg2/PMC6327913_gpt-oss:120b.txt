Thinking...
We need to extract details about pathway enrichment analysis from the article.

Search Methods section for enrichment analysis. In the Methods, they describe "Statistical analysis". Let's read that part:

In Statistical analysis they said: "The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses in our study demonstrated that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis was predominantly involved..." But need specific description of how they performed enrichment.

Search for "enrichment" in Methods. In Methods, after proteomics data analysis, they may have used some tool.

Let's locate "enrichment" mention. In the text: "The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses in our study demonstrated..." but not specific tool.

Later, in Results, they have GO and KEGG enrichment figures. They mention "Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses". But they don't mention tool.

Check the "Statistical analysis" part: "Only proteins with a p-value < 0.05 were considered significantly differentially expressed." That's for DE proteins, not enrichment.

In PPI network they used STRING? They didn't mention.

Thus for pathway enrichment analysis tool: Not described.

Version: Not described.

Gene set libraries: GO, KEGG (explicitly mentioned).

Custom background: Not described.

Statistical test: "Fisher's exact test" is mentioned in Statistical analysis? Wait they said: "The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses ...". In Statistical analysis they said: "We performed GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses." But the statistical test used? In "Statistical analysis" they mention: "We used Fisher's exact test to calculate the p-values for GO and KEGG enrichment." Let's verify. In the article snippet: "The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses in our study demonstrated...". Then later: "The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses in our study demonstrated that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis..." In Statistical analysis they say: "Only proteins with a p-value < 0.05 were considered significantly differentially expressed." Not for enrichment.

But earlier in the article, there is a line: "The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses in our study demonstrated..." and in the Methods, there may be a line: "Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed using ...". Let's search.

Scrolling the Methods section: At the end of Statistical analysis: "The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses in our study demonstrated..." That's not a method.

Thus we need to answer based on explicit statements.

Question 1: What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? Not described.

Version: Not described.

Gene set libraries: GO, KEGG (explicitly mentioned).

Custom background: Not described.

Statistical test(s): Not described. (they didn't specify test for enrichment).

Multiple testing correction: Not described (they mention "p-value threshold alone is not sufficient" but article says "Only pathways with p<0.05 were considered significant" but not mention FDR. Actually in Results they say "Only pathways with p<0.05 were considered significant." But not mention multiple testing correction. So answer No.

Now format table with columns: Question, Answer.

Let's produce.
