Thinking...
We need to answer 6 questions based on article text.

The article mentions functional enrichment analysis: "An Overrepresentation Enrichment Analysis (ORA) was performed by DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) version 6.8 [[184]70]; and, WebGestalt 2017 (WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit) [[185]71]. DAVID software revealed all Gene Ontology (GO) terms (BP, CC, and MF) and KEGG pathways of the co-expressed genes with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 5%. WebGestalt was used to find additional relevant KEGG pathways (FDR 5%) that may not appear in DAVID analysis, to better understand the biological mechanisms involved in each trait studied. The Bos taurus genome was used as background for both analyses."

So we have tools: DAVID version 6.8, WebGestalt 2017 (probably version not specified beyond year). It says "WebGestalt 2017". That's a version.

Gene set libraries: Gene Ontology (BP, CC, MF) and KEGG pathways. Also "Bos taurus genome was used as background". Not mention other libraries.

Background gene list: They used "Bos taurus genome" as background for both analyses. That is a specific background. So answer Yes.

Statistical test(s): Not explicitly mentioned. It just says "Overrepresentation Enrichment Analysis (ORA)". Typically uses hypergeometric but not described. So "Not described".

Multiple testing correction: They mention "False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 5%" for both DAVID and WebGestalt. So Yes.

Now produce table with columns: Question, Answer.

But the requirement: Provide table format with possibly multiple rows for each question? Might list tool names separately. Let's design:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Tool used for pathway enrichment analysis | DAVID; WebGestalt |
| Enrichment tool version(s) | DAVID v6.8; WebGestalt 2017 |
| Gene set libraries used | Gene Ontology (BP, CC, MF); KEGG pathways |
| Custom/specific background gene list used? | Yes |
| Statistical test(s) used | Not described |
| Multiple testing correction applied? | Yes |

Make sure to be terse.

...done thinking.
