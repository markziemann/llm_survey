Abstract

   Background and objectives: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a
   devastating malignancy with poor prognosis. Reliable biomarkers for MPM
   diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis are needed. The aim of this study
   was to identify genes associated with wound healing processes whose
   expression could serve as a prognostic factor in MPM patients.
   Materials and Methods: We used data mining techniques and
   transcriptomic analysis so as to assess the differential
   transcriptional expression of wound-healing-associated genes in MPM.
   Moreover, we investigated the potential prognostic value as well as the
   functional enrichments of gene ontologies relative to microRNAs
   (miRNAs) of the significantly differentially expressed
   wound-healing-related genes in MPM. Results: Out of the 82
   wound-healing-associated genes analyzed, 30 were found significantly
   deregulated in MPM. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that low ITGAV gene
   expression could serve as a prognostic factor favoring survival of MPM
   patients. Finally, gene ontology annotation enrichment analysis pointed
   to the members of the hsa-miR-143, hsa-miR-223, and the hsa-miR-29
   miRNA family members as important regulators of the deregulated wound
   healing genes. Conclusions: 30 wound-healing-related genes were
   significantly deregulated in MPM, which are potential targets of
   hsa-miR-143, hsa-miR-223, and the hsa-miR-29 miRNA family members. Out
   of those genes, ITGAV gene expression was a prognostic factor of
   overall survival in MPM. Our results highlight the role of impaired
   tissue repair in MPM development and should be further validated
   experimentally.

1. Introduction

   Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly aggressive tumor of
   the pleural mesothelium, a metabolically active cell monolayer covering
   the lungs and the chest wall [[39]1]. Neoplastic transformation of
   pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs) develops in the course of
   asbestos-induced chronic inflammation while genetic susceptibility
   factors, radiation exposure, and SV40 infection have also been
   indicated as co-factors in this process [[40]2,[41]3]. Recent evidence
   from animal studies and a few case series show that engineered
   nanoparticles, whose use is constantly expanding, can lead to a
   pathology similar to MPM and, thus, potentially lead to an increase of
   MPM incidence in the future and the same is the case with air
   pollution, which has been shown to lead to lung cancer [[42]4,[43]5].

   Diagnosis of MPM is challenging mainly because the pleura is a common
   site for metastasis and reactive, benign changes observed in the
   pleural space may be confused with MPM [[44]6]. At the same time,
   prognosis is poor since MPM therapeutic management depends on patient
   performance status, which is usually not good due to late diagnosis,
   and is potentially effective mostly in the epitheliod subtype [[45]7].
   For these reasons, the availability of effective bio markers is
   necessary for three clinical aspects of MPM: Early diagnosis,
   prognosis, and treatment outcome prediction [[46]8].

   Aberrant inflammation that could occur during wound healing has been
   linked to the pathogenesis of a variety of malignancies [[47]9,[48]10].
   Environmental and infectious agents are considered key players during
   carcinogenesis development as they conduce to tissue damage and
   inflammatory reactions [[49]9]. In the case of MPM, asbestos-induced
   chronic inflammation—mainly due to the production of reactive
   oxygen/nitrogen species—results in decreased tumor immunity [[50]11].
   Location and inflammatory response type impact on the overall prognosis
   of MPM patients [[51]9].

   PMCs hold a central role in the initiation and resolution of serosal
   inflammation and repair by secreting various pro- and anti-
   inflammatory mediators along with immunomodulatory ones
   [[52]12,[53]13]. It is worth noting that mesothelial regeneration of
   injured mesothelial surfaces appears diffusely across the traumatized
   area in contrast to epithelial-like surfaces, in which healing occurs
   solely from the wound edges [[54]12]. Mesothelial injury and impaired
   healing can lead to the development of pleural effusions, serosal
   adhesions, and malignant mesothelioma [[55]13,[56]14]. Several studies
   have confirmed that following damage, mesothelial cells undergo
   mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT), a process similar to
   epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [[57]15]. It has been
   reported that the aggressiveness of MPM may be explained by its partial
   fibroblastic phenotype in the context of EMT conferring both high
   invasiveness and chemoresistance [[58]16].

   Although the above observations highlight the importance of normal
   serosal repair following injury, a thorough investigation of the exact
   role of wound-healing-associated genes in MPM development has not been
   performed [[59]15]. Research in this direction is even more imperative
   nowadays due to the wide use of nanoparticles in a variety of
   applications since nano-sized fibrous particulates have similar
   properties to asbestos thus raising safety concerns for human health
   [[60]17,[61]18].

   Here, we aimed at the identification of the differential expression of
   wound-healing-associated genes in MPM. For this purpose, we used
   established data mining techniques and transcriptomic analysis
   [[62]19,[63]20,[64]21,[65]22]. Moreover, we investigated their
   potential prognostic value as well as the functional enrichments of
   gene ontologies (GO) relative to the microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate
   the significantly differentially expressed wound-healing-related genes
   in MPM.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Transcriptomic Analysis of Wound-Healing-Associated Genes in MPM

   The Oncomine Cancer Microarray database Premium Research Edition
   ([66]http://www.oncomine.org) was used to investigate the expression
   profile of wound-healing-associated genes in MPM compared with healthy
   controls. Gene expression data from the GDS1220 dataset of GEO Profiles
   were used in which the Affymetrix Human Genome U133A array was used
   assessing 12,624 genes [[67]23]. We analyzed available data for 82
   wound-healing-related genes (from the according list of genes included
   in the Wound Healing RT^2 Profiler PCR Arrays from Qiagen) that were
   assessed in the GDS1220 study ([68]Table 1), so as to detect gene
   expression differences between MPM specimens and healthy controls
   [[69]23]. The raw data were downloaded in Excel format from Oncomine
   and only the ones referring to surgically excised samples were
   selected, leading to the use of n = 40 MPM cases and n = 9 controls (n
   = 5 pleura and n = 4 lung samples). The gene expression data were log
   transformed, median centered per array, and the standard deviation was
   normalized to one per array as described previously [[70]24].

2.2. Evaluation of the Significantly Differentially Expressed
Wound-Healing-Related Genes for Prognostic Relevance

   We investigated the prognostic relevance of the significantly
   differentially expressed wound-healing-related genes by creating
   survival curves, using the publicly available survival data of each
   patient from the GDS1220 study. Patients were grouped as high
   expressing (above median) and low expressing (below median) per each
   significantly differentially expressed gene based on the median value
   of gene expression. To further evaluate the prognostic significance of
   the genes that were identified in the analysis of the GDS1220
   mesothelioma study, we constructed survival curves from data derived
   from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For this analysis, we used the
   PROGgeneV2 Prognostic Database software following the same approach
   used previously [[72]25].

2.3. Functional Annotation Enrichment Gene Ontology Analysis of the miRNAs
That Regulate the Significantly Differentially Expressed
Wound-Healing-Related Genes in MPM

   Functional annotation enrichment analysis of GO relative to Biological
   Functions and miRNAs was performed, assuming the statistical background
   of the whole genome. The complete list of the significantly
   differentially expressed wound-healing-related genes was introduced to
   the portal ToppFun, an application of the ToppGene Suite
   ([73]https://toppgene.cchmc.org/). ToppFun reports functional
   enrichment of input gene lists based on transcriptome (gene
   expression), proteome (protein domains and interactions), regulome
   (transcription factor binding sites and miRNA), ontologies (GO,
   pathway), phenotype (human disease and mouse phenotype), pharmacome
   (drug–gene associations), and bibliome (literature co-citation)
   [[74]26]. Functional enrichments are provided by the ToppFun algorithm,
   which employs hypergeometric distribution with multiple correction
   testing (false discovery rate; FDR) to determine statistical
   significance. Analysis was performed during February 2019.

2.4. Statistical Analysis

   The results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software,
   San Diego, CA) and R 3.3.2 [[75]27]. Data distribution was tested by
   the Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality test. Comparisons of gene expressions
   were performed with the one-tailed t-test for parametric data and the
   Mann–Whitney U-test for nonparametric data. The Benjamini–Hochberg FDR
   was employed for multiple correction testing, which reports FDR (or
   q-value), in order to corroborate the validity of the results. The
   calculation of the q statistic was based on the formula Q = P value ×
   total number of genes/P-value rank [[76]24]. Statistical significance
   was set at the q < 0.05 level. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were
   generated using the overall survival data of the MPM patients and by
   grouping them into high and low gene expressions based on the median.
   The log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test, which gives equal weight to deaths at
   all time points, was used. Differences were deemed significant with a p
   ≤ 0.05. A multivariate regression was performed using the initial
   dataset of 30 differentially expressed genes where the ITGAV gene
   expression was chosen as the dependent variable. At first, all
   predictors were considered, and a model was derived. This mode had an
   acceptable R2 value but had to be discarded since the predictors were
   over-fit. Next, a backwards method was implemented that takes into
   consideration the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) value of each
   predictor. If VIF of an independent variable exceeded the predetermined
   threshold value of 5, that predictor was discarded from the model.
   Thus, one avoids multi-collinearity in a model but may still obtain an
   overfitted model. To avoid this, an additional backwards step-wise
   regression was performed on the surviving variable so as to have a
   robust final model.

3. Results

3.1. Identification of the Differential Transcriptional Expression Of
Wound-Healing-Associated Genes in MPM

   Out of the 82 wound-healing-related genes analyzed, 30 were found
   significantly differentially expressed in MPM (14 up-regulated/16
   down-regulated, results summarized in [77]Table 2). Ten genes (ITGB3,
   ITGB5, COL5A3, VEGFA, WNT5A, WISP1, CTNNB1, F13A1, PLAUR, TIMP1) were
   found significantly deregulated in the initial mean value comparison
   test (p = 0.008, p = 0.023, p = 0.016, p = 0.0115, p = 0.0205, p =
   0.0055, p = 0.024, p = 0.0445, p = 0.0405, p = 0.046, respectively) but
   not after the multiple correction testing (q = 0.055, q = 0.1649, q =
   0,128, q = 0.1905, q = 0.314, q = 0.055, q = 0.133, q = 0.1898, q =
   0.1789, q = 0.1375, respectively).

3.2. Prognostic Significance of ITGAV Gene Expression in MPM

   Kaplan–Meier analysis of the significantly deregulated
   wound-healing-related genes in MPM identified the ITGAV gene expression
   as a predictor of overall survival. Graphical representation of the
   ITGAV gene expression from the GDS1220 study is shown in [79]Figure 1A.
   In the GDS1220 study, MPM patients with low ITGAV expression had a
   median overall survival of 15.7 months versus 12 months of those that
   had high expression (p = 0.0263) ([80]Figure 1B). Analysis from the
   TCGA patient data derived from the PROGgeneV2 database corroborates
   that low ITGAV gene expression favors survival in MPM patients (p =
   0.001) ([81]Figure 2).

   that low ITGAV gene expression favors survival (shown in days) in MPM
   patients.

3.3. Statistical Modeling Reveals A Positive Correlation of ITGAV and COL5A1
Gene Expressions

   Multivariate regression was performed as shown in [86]Table 3, and the
   following model was obtained using backwards selection methods:
   ITGAV = 1.89725 + 0.41537 COL5A1 (1)

Table 3.

   The model explains the 43.54% (adjusted R^2 = 0.4354) of the
   variability of the response data around its mean. F-statistic and
   p-value indicate that the model is significant for the explanation of
   the variability of the response data. The coefficients of the model are
   positive, hence whenever the value of COL5A1 increases, the same
   happens to the value of ITGAV. The value of each coefficient shows the
   increase of the value of ITGAV if the corresponding variable is
   increased or decreased by one unit, while the rest remain fixed.

3.4. Enriched Gene Ontologies (GO) Relative To Regulating miRNAs of the
Significantly Differentially Expressed Wound-Healing-Associated Genes In MPM

   The complete set of the significantly differentially expressed
   wound-healing-associated genes was entered in the ToppFun software. The
   top five enriched GO for biological functions are presented in
   [88]Table 4, and the miRNAs that regulate the differentially expressed
   genes are shown in [89]Table 5.

4. Discussion

   Chronic tissue repair and insistent immune system stimulation following
   the accumulation of inhaled asbestos fibers in the pleural space are
   key oncogenic processes during MPM development [[94]28]. In this study,
   we used transcriptome data mining in order to assess the differential
   mRNA expression of wound-healing-related genes in MPM. We analyzed
   available data for 82 genes, of which 30 were found significantly
   deregulated in MPM specimens compared with healthy tissues. Identified
   genes are mainly involved in inflammation (CXCL2, CXCL5, IL6, IL10),
   cellular adhesion (ITGA3, ITGAV, ITGB6), tissue remodeling (CTSG, F3,
   PLG, SERPINE1), and extracellular matrix organization (COL1A1, COL3A1,
   COL5A1, COL5A2, CSF3, HBEGF, MIF, TGFA, VTN), fundamental processes in
   the induction of EMT and cancer progression
   [[95]29,[96]30,[97]31,[98]32]. A recent study has suggested that
   asbestos induces mesothelial-to-fibroblastic transition in an
   inflammasome-dependent manner and this seems to apply for other
   pathogenic particles as well [[99]28,[100]33,[101]34].

   The acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype by PMCs has been correlated
   with the sarcomatoid histological type of MPM, the latter being
   associated to worse prognosis [[102]16,[103]35]. It has been suggested
   that in MPM patients with sarcomatoid histology, radical surgery should
   be excluded, and therapy should aim at symptom control and preservation
   of quality of life [[104]36]. Considering the importance of clear
   histological subtype distinction in the initiation of the appropriate
   therapeutic intervention, it would be of great interest to investigate
   the transcriptional expression of the 30 significantly deregulated
   genes—identified in this study—with respect to the MPM phenotype
   [[105]22]. Unfortunately, data relative to the histological subtype of
   MPM specimens were not available in the GDS1220 mesothelioma study.

   Among the 30 significantly differentially expressed
   wound-healing-associated genes in MPM, ITGAV was identified as a
   predictor of overall survival in patients suffering from this type of
   cancer. In the transcriptomic analysis, ITGAV was found significantly
   up-regulated in MPM subjects compared with healthy controls, and
   survival analysis revealed that low ITGAV gene expression favors the
   survival of MPM patients. In accordance with our results, recent
   studies have reported the tumor-promoting effect of ITGAV via the
   furtherance of the EMT process [[106]37,[107]38]. The gene expression
   level of the ITGAV integrin has also been associated with global
   survival in patients with colorectal cancer, both in univariate and
   multivariate analyses [[108]39].

   Following the above findings, our regression modelling predicted a
   significant positive correlation in the expression profiles of the
   ITGAV and COL5A1 genes. The latter encodes the a1 chain of type V
   collagen, a fibril-forming collagen that is mainly distributed in the
   lung, cornea, bone, and fetal membranes, together with type I collagen
   [[109]40,[110]41]. Interestingly, COL5A1 has been included in a 10-gene
   signature that is associated with poor survival both in patients with
   high-grade serous ovarian cancer and renal cell carcinoma
   [[111]42,[112]43].

   Finally, the biological functions mediated by the differentially
   regulated genes as revealed by the GO functional enrichment analysis
   were pertinent to wound healing functions, such as cell locomotion,
   mobility, and migration. Furthermore, the GO annotation enrichment
   analysis predicted that the 30 wound-healing-related genes that were
   found significantly deregulated in MPM might be targets of the
   hsa-miR-143, hsa-miR-223, and the hsa-miR-29 miRNA family members.
   MicroRNAs have emerged as significant players in the biology of MPM,
   whilst miRNA-based therapy for the treatment of MPM has been suggested
   as an exciting area of research [[113]44]. The hsa-miR-29c has been
   identified as an epigenetic regulator in MPM via the down-regulation of
   DNA methyltransferases and the up-regulation of demethylating genes
   [[114]45]. In addition, increased expression of this miRNA has been
   linked to a more favorable prognosis in MPM [[115]45]. On the other
   hand, hsa-miR-143 has been linked to MPM only once, in a study that
   showed that its expression is significantly reduced in MPM as compared
   to non-neoplastic corresponding tissue [[116]46]. Its functional role
   in MPM is unknown, however in other cancers, the decreased expression
   of has-miR-143 has been shown to promote EMT, tumor growth, and
   metastasis [[117]47,[118]48]. Overall, these reports strengthen the
   findings of our in silico transcriptomic analysis implicating 30
   wound-healing-associated genes in MPM pathogenicity. However, it is
   imperative to investigate the transcriptional expression of these genes
   in the clinical setting, taking into account both MPM phenotype and
   history of asbestos exposure.

5. Conclusions

   Conclusively, using data mining and transcriptomic analysis, we have
   identified a significant deregulation of 30 wound-healing-related genes
   in MPM specimens compared to healthy tissues. We have also demonstrated
   that these genes are possible targets of the hsa-miR-143, hsa-miR-223,
   and the hsa-miR-29 miRNA family members, which contribute in MPM
   pathobiology as evidenced by recent studies. Finally, we have
   identified ITGAV as a novel predictor of overall survival in MPM. Our
   results highlight the role of impaired tissue repair in MPM development
   and should be further validated experimentally.
