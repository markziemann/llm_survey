Here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis methods used in the provided article, organized for your table:

**1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**

PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) was used for pathway enrichment analysis.

**2. Was a tool version number provided?**

Yes, PANTHER version 17.1 was used.

**3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**

Multiple gene set libraries were queried:

*   Gene Ontology (GO) biological process, molecular function, and cellular component.
*   KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways.
*   Reactome pathways.
*   PANTHER biological processes and pathways.

**4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**

Yes. The background gene list consisted of all genes represented on the Illumina microarray used in the study. This ensured that enrichment results were relative to the genes actually assayed.

**5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**

A binomial test was used to determine the statistical significance of pathway enrichment.

**6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**

Yes. False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction was used with a Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control for multiple testing and adjust p-values.
