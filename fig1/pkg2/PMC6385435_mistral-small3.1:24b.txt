1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) server was used for pathway enrichment analysis.

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**
   - Not described.

3. **What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**
   - GO (Gene Ontology)

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - Yes. A list with 10,919 genes reported as expressed in bovine skeletal muscle by the EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas was used as background list for the tissue restricted gene enrichment analysis.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**
   - Not described.

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - Yes. Significance of each enriched term was adjusted applying the Benjamini-Hochberg p-value correction.
