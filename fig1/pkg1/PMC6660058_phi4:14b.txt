Based on the provided scientific article, here's how the pathway enrichment analysis details can be collated:

1. **Tool Used for Pathway Enrichment Analysis**:  
   The tool used was Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; QIAGEN).

2. **Tool Version Number Provided**:  
   Not described.

3. **Gene Set Library Queried**:  
   The specific gene set library is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but it's implied that canonical pathways and potential upstream regulators were analyzed using IPA, which typically queries its own proprietary database of biological interactions.

4. **Background Gene List Defined for Pathway Enrichment Analysis**:  
   Not described. Typically, a background list would be defined as part of the analysis process, but this detail is not provided in the article.

5. **Statistical Test Used for Enrichment Analysis**:  
   The specific statistical test used by IPA for enrichment analysis is not described in the text. IPA generally uses proprietary algorithms and calculations to assess significance.

6. **False Discovery Rate Correction Used**:  
   Not described. It's common practice to use false discovery rate (FDR) correction methods like Benjamini-Hochberg, but whether this was applied here isn't specified in the article.

These responses are derived from the information provided in the Methods section and related parts of the article. If further details were needed, consulting the full software documentation or contacting the authors might be necessary.
