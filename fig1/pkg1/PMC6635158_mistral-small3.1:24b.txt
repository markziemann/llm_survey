To better understand pathway enrichment analysis conducted in this scientific article, I have answered the questions below:

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - The article does not explicitly describe the tool used for pathway enrichment analysis.

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**
   - Not described.

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome, or other)?**
   - KEGG was mentioned as the gene set library used for pathway enrichment analysis.

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - Not described.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**
   - Not described.

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - Not described.
