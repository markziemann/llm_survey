| 1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2. Was a tool version number provided?           | Not described                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3. What gene set library was queried?          | Not described, but the text mentions querying for "pathways" and references specific pathways like "dermatan, chrondroitin or heparan sulfate biosynthesis", "unfolded protein response", etc. suggesting use of a curated knowledge base. |
| 4. Was a background gene list defined?           | Not described                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5. What statistical test was used?                | Not described                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 6. Was false discovery rate correction used?    | Not described                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
