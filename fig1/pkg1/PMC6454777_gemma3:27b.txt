Okay, here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis methods described in the provided text, presented in a way that can be easily collated into a table.  I've extracted the information directly from the text, and noted "not described" when details are missing.

**1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**

Not described. The text mentions functional annotation and correlation analyses, but doesn't specify the tool used for pathway enrichment.

**2. Was a tool version number provided?**

Not described. Since the tool isn't named, no version number is provided.

**3. What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**

Not described. The text does not state which gene set library was used for the pathway enrichment analysis.

**4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**

Not described.  The text doesn't mention the use of a background gene list or how it was defined.

**5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**

Not described. The text doesn't mention any statistical test.

**6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**

Not described. The text does not state whether any correction for multiple testing (like FDR) was applied.

**Summary Table:**

| **Question** | **Answer** |
|---|---|
| Tool Used | Not described |
| Tool Version | Not described |
| Gene Set Library | Not described |
| Background Gene List | Not described |
| Statistical Test | Not described |
| False Discovery Rate Correction | Not described |

**Important Note:** This article provides very limited methodological detail regarding pathway enrichment analysis. It's impossible to determine the specifics of their analysis based solely on the text provided.
