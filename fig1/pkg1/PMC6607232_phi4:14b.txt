Here's an examination based on the details provided in your text regarding the methodology of pathway enrichment analysis:

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - The tool used for pathway enrichment analysis is the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**
   - No, the version number of the tool was not provided in the article.

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**
   - The gene set library queried was KEGG.

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - A background gene list is not explicitly described in the article.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**
   - The statistical significance of pathways was determined using P-values, but the specific statistical test used for enrichment analysis is not described.

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - There is no mention of false discovery rate (FDR) correction being applied in the article.
