Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know how the pathway enrichment analysis was conducted in the given article. They provided the abstract and some sections, so I need to look through those.

First, I'll start by checking the Methods section. The user mentioned that the information might be in the Methods, but it could also be in other sections. Let me scan through the provided text.

Looking at the Methods section in the abstract and the additional files. The authors mention they used a meth-miRNA-mRNA network, but the specific tools for pathway enrichment aren't detailed there. The main body of the abstract doesn't include a Methods section. However, in the Conclusions and the additional files, there's some info.

Wait, in the additional files, like Additional file 2 and 4, there are tables listing tumor suppressors and oncogenes with hazard ratios and p-values. But that's survival analysis, not pathway enrichment.

The main text under the "Results" and "Discussion" sections mentions pathway enrichment. For example, in the Discussion, they refer to metabolic pathways and cell cycle signaling. But the actual methods for pathway analysis aren't described in the abstract or the provided sections. The user is asking for the specific tools and parameters used.

Looking at the "Authorsâ€™ contributions" and "Acknowledgements" sections, nothing about pathway analysis tools. The "Conclusions" also just summarize the findings without methods.

Since the user said to check the Methods section first, but in the provided text, there's no explicit Methods section. The abstract and other sections don't mention tools like DAVID, GSEA, or others. The answer might be that the article didn't describe the pathway enrichment analysis methods in detail.

So for each question:

1. Tool used? Not described.
2. Version number? No.
3. Gene set library? Not specified.
4. Background gene list? Not mentioned.
5. Statistical test? Not provided.
6. FDR correction? Not mentioned.

I need to confirm that the article didn't include these details. Since the user says to check the Methods section but it's not present in the provided text, the answer is that the authors did not provide details in the article.

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**  
   Not described.  

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**  
   Not described.  

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**  
   Not described.  

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**  
   Not described.  

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**  
   Not described.  

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**  
   Not described.

**Explanation**: The article does not explicitly describe the methods used for pathway enrichment analysis in the provided sections (including the abstract, discussion, and additional files). While terms like "metabolic pathways" and "cell cycle signaling" are mentioned, the specific tools, libraries, statistical tests, or corrections for pathway analysis are not detailed in the text. The focus of the study appears to be on methylation, miRNA, and mRNA networks rather than explicit pathway enrichment methods.
