Here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis methods used in the article, presented in a format suitable for a table:

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**
   Not described

3. **What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**
   Not described (The article states pathways were recognised, but doesn't specify the database IPA used. It mentions canonical pathways, implying a curated knowledge base, but the specific library isn't stated.)

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   Not described

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**
   Not described

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**
   P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant, suggesting a form of multiple testing correction was likely applied within IPA, though the specific method (e.g., FDR, Benjamini-Hochberg) isnâ€™t explicitly stated.
