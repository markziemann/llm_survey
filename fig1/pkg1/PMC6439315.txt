Abstract

   Schizophrenia is a chronic, debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder.
   Multiple transcriptomic gene expression profiling analysis has been
   used to identify schizophrenia-associated genes, unravel
   disease-associated biomarkers, and predict clinical outcomes. We aimed
   to identify gene expression regulation, underlying pathways, and their
   roles in schizophrenia pathogenesis. We searched the Gene Expression
   Omnibus (GEO) database for microarray studies of fibroblasts,
   lymphoblasts, and post-mortem brains of schizophrenia patients. Our
   analysis demonstrated high FOS expression in non-neural peripheral
   samples and low FOS expression in brain tissues of schizophrenia
   patients compared with healthy controls. FOS exhibited predictive value
   for schizophrenia patients in these datasets. Kyoto Encyclopedia of
   Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that “amphetamine
   addiction” was among the top 10 significantly enriched KEGG pathways.
   FOS and FOSB, which are implicated in the amphetamine addiction
   pathway, were up-regulated in schizophrenia fibroblast samples.
   Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed that
   proteins closely interacting with FOS-encoded protein were also
   involved in the amphetamine addiction pathway. Pearson correlation test
   indicated that FOS showed positive correlation with genes in the
   amphetamine pathway. The results revealed that FOS was acceptable as a
   biomarker for schizophrenia and may be involved in schizophrenia
   pathogenesis.

Introduction

   Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder
   affecting 1% of the population, posing a severe social and economic
   burden on societies worldwide ([40]McGrath et al., 2008; [41]Howes and
   Murray, 2014). Common symptoms include positive and negative symptoms
   and cognitive deficits ([42]Lewis et al., 2012). Besides its complex
   symptomatology, schizophrenia is considered a neurodevelopmental
   disorder with heterogeneous, polygenic, and highly heritable etiology
   ([43]Quadrato et al., 2016). Schizophrenia affects gross architectural
   structures, specific cell types, and ion channels across different
   brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, thalamic
   reticular nucleus, and basal ganglia ([44]Heyes et al., 2015;
   [45]Mouchlianitis et al., 2016; [46]Goff et al., 2017). However, there
   is heterogeneity in the molecular and genetic phenotypes of patients.
   The precise etiology and pathogenesis underlying schizophrenia are not
   fully known. Identifications of gene changes as biomarkers for
   schizophrenia may be helpful for diagnostic assessment of patients.

   Strong evidence suggests that dysfunction of multiple neurotransmitter
   systems may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia,
   including dopamine (DA), glutamate, and serotonin neurotransmission
   ([47]de Bartolomeis et al., 2014). For example, N-methyl-D-aspartate
   (NMDA) receptor antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP), ketamine, and
   MK-801 have psychotomimetic effects and have been used to generate
   pharmacological animal models of schizophrenia ([48]Zuo et al., 2009).
   Another well-established pre-clinical schizophrenia rodent model is
   based on amphetamine (AMPH)-induced dopaminergic dysregulation
   ([49]Renard et al., 2016). AMPH-induced schizophrenia-like sensorimotor
   cognitive deficits are severely disrupted in schizophrenia
   ([50]Pedrazzi et al., 2015; [51]Renard et al., 2016). Genes involved in
   these pathways have been examined to better understand the pathogenesis
   of schizophrenia and points to new targets for therapeutic
   investigation ([52]Karam et al., 2010; [53]Hall et al., 2015;
   [54]Network et al., 2015). Environmental risk factors and their
   interactions with gene expression also play important roles in
   schizophrenia pathophysiology ([55]Van Winkel et al., 2010).
   Understanding the affected pathways and specific gene expression
   profiles in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia may help to uncover
   disease-associated biomarkers for risk assessment, regulatory
   mechanisms, and personalization of treatment.

   The recently developed technique of gene expression profiling analysis
   of the whole transcriptome has been widely used to identify
   schizophrenia-associated genes, unravel disease-associated biomarkers,
   and predict clinical outcomes. Several whole-genome expression studies
   have utilized gene expression data from human fibroblasts, blood, and
   post-mortem brain samples to identify gene alterations in schizophrenia
   patients compared with healthy controls ([56]Rollins et al., 2010;
   [57]Cattane et al., 2015). Expression studies on post-mortem brains and
   peripheral cells demonstrated overlapping gene expression results;
   however, contrasting results have also been observed in different
   studies. The heterogeneity between gene expression profiles in
   peripheral cells and in post-mortem brains can be attributed to
   intrinsic differences in expression levels between the central nervous
   system (CNS) and peripheral tissues; and confounding factors in
   patients themselves, including the course of disease, age, living
   habits, environmental events, and clinical medications. These problems
   can be partly solved by integrated analysis of gene expression data
   from multiple studies and multiple tissues.

   On this basis, the aim of our study was to elucidate gene expression
   changes in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and to acquire new
   potential biomarkers for diagnostic prediction. We searched for
   microarray data for schizophrenia from the Gene Expression Omnibus
   (GEO) database. Different gene expression microarray studies with
   schizophrenia samples were selected and compared to perform a reliable
   genome-wide gene expression profiling analysis. First, we analyzed
   different microarray gene expression studies with a sample of
   fibroblasts from schizophrenia patients and controls to identify
   differentially expressed genes. Second, we compared the gene alteration
   results observed in different schizophrenia post-mortem brain
   expression studies. Third, we compared the results by analyzing gene
   expression changes in samples from schizophrenia mice models. Our
   analysis enables identification of gene expression regulation in
   different body areas of schizophrenia patients, disease progression,
   and confirmation of pre-clinical studies. This study may help us
   identify risk genes for schizophrenia and the underlying pathways. Our
   study may be applicable in elucidating the pathogenesis of other
   neuropsychiatric disorders.

Materials and Methods

Inclusion Criteria

   To identify specific gene expression changes in schizophrenia, we
   performed a systematic search in the GEO database for schizophrenia
   studies. The keywords used for the GEO database search were:
   “schizophrenia” AND “expression profiling by array” for “study type”
   AND “tissue” for “attribute name” AND “homo sapiens” for “organism.”
   Details of the search strategy and analysis process are outlined in
   [58]Supplementary Figure S1. The final studies were selected based on
   the criteria that (1) transcriptomic profiles were analyzed in skin
   fibroblasts of schizophrenia patients; (2) original data in CEL format
   could be downloaded; and (3) matched samples of healthy controls were
   used.

   After screening 26 studies in GEO, the GEO dataset [59]GSE62333^[60]1
   was selected, which studied 20 schizophrenia patients matched with 20
   healthy controls with human skin fibroblast samples based on the
   [61]GPL11532 [HuGene-1_1-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST Array
   ([62]Cattane et al., 2015). Array [63]GPL11532 has 33,297 probes. All
   schizophrenia patients fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia.
   The control samples consisted of healthy volunteers without drug or
   alcohol abuse and without family history of psychiatric diseases. Other
   diseases such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, metabolic
   disorders, and serious illnesses were also excluded in both groups.

   To maintain consistency, we also selected GEO datasets with lymphoblast
   samples from schizophrenia patients. Finally, dataset
   [64]GSE73129^[65]2, which is based on platform [66]GPL570
   [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array was
   selected for validation. Array [67]GPL570 contained 54,675 probes.
   Human lymphoblast samples from 36 schizophrenia patients and 41 healthy
   controls were included. We compared gene expression levels in human
   prefrontal cortex samples in [68]GSE92538^[69]3, comprising 45
   schizophrenia patients and 46 healthy controls. We also validated the
   results with a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis of mouse prefrontal
   cortex and hippocampus samples. [70]GSE10784^[71]4 was selected, which
   contained 10 Df(16)A/+ mice and 10 control mice.

Data Analysis

   Gene Expression Omnibus^[72]5 provides raw data (CEL file) and
   normalized data downloads of the: (1) citation information, (2)
   geo-annotation, and (3) statistical matrix. Four GEO datasets were
   included in the analysis, [73]GSE62333, [74]GSE73129, [75]GSE92538, and
   [76]GSE10784. All of the original data came from publicly available
   datasets.

   R language was mainly used for statistical analysis. The original CEL
   data was subjected to background correction, normalization, and
   expression calculation before further analysis. We completed the data
   preprocessing by RMA (R package “affy”) ([77]Gautier et al., 2004).
   Probes that did not match any known genes were removed. Only probes
   with the highest interquartile range were included for further
   analysis, if more than one probe matched with a gene. The selected
   probes were subjected to annotation using the R annotation the package
   “annotate.” The gene expression profiling data was transformed by
   log[2]and extracted for DEG identification and analysis. The DEGs were
   identified using the R package “limma.” Spearman correlation analysis
   was performed using the “circlize” package ([78]Gu et al., 2014), ROC
   curves were derived using the “pROC” package ([79]Robin et al., 2011).
   Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the prcomp
   function of R “stats” package, and visualization was done using the
   ggplot2 package. The heatmap of DEGs was generated by clustering (using
   the R package “pheatmap”) with p-value <0.05 between schizophrenia and
   control samples. Associated KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
   Genomes) enrichment analysis of the 250 DEGs was generated by Omics
   Bean and illustrates the results of KEGG pathway analysis. STRING
   database (version 9.1) was used to analyze protein–protein interaction
   (PPI) networks of the candidate genes. Dot plots of expression levels
   of identified genes were drawn by GraphPad Prism. All statistical tests
   were two-sided. A p-value less than 0.05 is considered to be
   statistically significant.

Results

Identification and Functional Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes
(DEGs) in Schizophrenia and Healthy Control

   The GEO dataset [80]GSE62333 was selected to identify DEGs in human
   skin fibroblast samples from schizophrenia patients and matched healthy
   controls. After the samples were normalized by the robust multichip
   averaging (RMA) process, the expression levels (transformed by log[2])
   of all included samples were extracted. The DEGs between two groups
   were calculated by the Classical Bayesian algorithm with 33,297 probes
   included. After screening using the criteria of | FC| > 1.2 and p-value
   < 0.05, 1,022 probes with significantly different expression levels
   between the two groups (517 up-regulated probes and 505 down-regulated
   probes) were identified. Probes that did not match any known genes were
   removed in further analysis. We selected the 250 probes with the
   highest inter-quartile range (125 up-regulated probes and 125
   down-regulated probes, respectively). A heatmap that shows the 250
   top-regulated genes matched with 250 probes between schizophrenia and
   control groups is presented in [81]Figure 1A. The hierarchical
   clustering of these 250 genes demonstrated significant differences
   between schizophrenia and control groups.

   We performed KEGG enrichment analysis of the 250 DEGs for functional
   analysis to identify the biological processes, pathways, and networks
   shared by these genes. The top 10 significantly enriched KEGG pathways
   (p-value < 0.05) were “AMPH addiction,” “oxytocin signaling,” “pathways
   in cancer,” “estrogen signaling,” “vascular smooth muscle contraction,”
   “Ras signaling,” “AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic
   complications,” “choline metabolism in cancer,” “Chagas disease,” and
   “Rap1 signaling.” The network model generated by Omics Bean illustrates
   the results of KEGG pathway enrichment analysis ([85]Figure 1B). A
   histogram was plotted based on the functional analysis to display the
   percentage of genes affected in these pathways ([86]Figure 1C).

FOS Up-Regulation in Schizophrenia Peripheral Samples

   After confirming the pathways of 250 DEGs by KEGG enrichment analysis,
   we ranked the top 10 DEGs between the schizophrenia and control samples
   to determine which pathways these genes were involved in. The top five
   up-regulated genes (FOSB, MMP1, FOS, RANBP3L, and SNORA38B) and top
   five down-regulated genes (SNORA68, SNORA23, SNORA20, ACTG2, and
   SNORA3A) were arranged by degree of change. Detailed information on
   these genes is listed in [87]Table 1. Dot plots illustrated that all 10
   DEGs were differentially expressed between the two groups (p-value <
   0.05), suggesting that these genes may be useful as biomarkers of
   schizophrenia ([88]Figure 2). We also performed PCA and while there was
   a separation of some samples into diagnostic groups, overall there was
   no clear separation between control and SCZ samples ([89]Supplementary
   Figure S2).

   Scatter plot of expression levels of the identified top 10
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GEO dataset [93]GSE62333. The
   top five up-regulated genes (FOSB, MMP1, FOS, RANBP3L, and SNORA38B)
   and top five down-regulated genes (SNORA68, SNORA23, SNORA20, ACTG2,
   and SNORA3A) were arranged by degree of change. Detailed information on
   these genes is listed in [94]Table 1.

   Among the top 10 DEGs, five of them (SNORA38B, SNORA68, SNORA23,
   SNORA20, and SNORA3A) were non-coding genes. Five of the top 10 DEGs
   were protein-coding genes (RANBP3L, ACTG2, MMP1, FOSB, and FOS). Two
   genes in the FOS family (FOS and FOSB) were up-regulated in
   schizophrenia samples. Among the top 10 DEGs, FOS was most closely
   related to schizophrenia pathogenesis. Previous research has shown that
   NMDA receptor antagonist-induced and AMPH-induced pharmacological
   animal models of schizophrenia can up-regulate FOS gene expression
   ([95]Zuo et al., 2009; [96]Renard et al., 2016). And we have observed
   that “AMPH addiction” was one of the most significantly enriched KEGG
   pathways in schizophrenia samples. This suggested that FOS may have
   some connection with AMPH addiction pathway in schizophrenia samples.

   Based on these findings, we constructed PPI networks of FOS to explore
   the known and predicted proteins interacted with FOS, as well as the
   underlying pathways using STRING. The STRING database is a biological
   database and web resource which can be used for exploring the known and
   predicted interaction networks of a particular protein. Ten
   gene-encoded proteins (JUN, CREB1, ATF2, JUNB, JUND, MAPK1, MAPK3,
   MAPK8, MAPK9, and IL2) were in the interaction network of FOS
   ([97]Figure 3A). The edges between FOS and its 10 predicted functional
   partners represent protein–protein associations. The edges between the
   proteins do not necessarily imply binding interactions; edges in
   different colors point to different methods of identifying
   interactions. Already-known interactions can be found from curated
   databases or experimental results. Predicted interactions arise from
   text mining, co-expression, and protein homology. All proteins
   interacting with FOS were generated from known results from curated
   databases and experiments. Several interactions were predicted by text
   mining or co-expression. Further functional enrichment analysis of the
   protein network in KEGG pathways revealed that FOS protein is involved
   in the AMPH pathway. Three proteins that interact with FOS protein
   (JUN, CREB1, and ATF2) were also implicated in the AMPH pathway
   ([98]Figure 3B). Proteins closely interacting with FOS protein were
   also found to participate in other psychoactive drug pathways, such as
   cocaine addiction and alcoholism. KEGG functional enrichment analysis
   of all genes in the network is shown in [99]Figure 3C.

   or experimental results. Predicted interactions can come from text
   mining, co-expression, and protein homology. (B) Further functional
   enrichment analysis of the protein network in KEGG pathways. FOS, JUN,
   CREB1, and ATF2 are involved in the amphetamine pathway. Proteins
   closely interacting with FOS protein also participate in other
   psychoactive drug pathways, such as cocaine addiction and alcoholism.
   (C) KEGG functional enrichment analysis of all genes in the
   protein–protein interaction network.

   Our finding from PPI networks of FOS suggested FOS is tightly related
   to genes involved in FOS. Therefore, we further explicate the roles of
   the FOS gene and the AMPH pathway in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
   We calculated genes involved in the AMPH pathway from the 1,022 probes
   with significantly different gene expression levels (using the R
   package “pheatmap”). Seven genes in the AMPH pathway are shown in the
   heatmap ([102]Figure 4A). To examine the relationship between FOS and
   other genes in the AMPH pathway, we calculated a Spearman correlation
   of gene expression levels of fold changes using the [103]GSE62333
   dataset. The results indicated that FOS was positively correlated with
   other genes in the AMPH pathway, especially FOSB, JUN, and GRIA3
   ([104]Figure 4B). Corrgram is a visual display technique to represent
   the pattern of correlations. To get further understanding the
   relationship between FOS gene and the AMPH pathway, Corrgram was
   derived according to r-value between FOS and six genes in the AMPH
   pathway ([105]Figure 4C). There was a positive correlation between FOS
   and the following genes: FOSB (r = 0.73, p = 1.02E-07), JUN (r = 0.66,
   p = 0.000003) GRIA3 (r = 0.38, p = 0.014374). There was a negative
   correlation between FOS and CALM3 (r = −0.49, p = 0.001441). There was
   no correlation between FOS and the following genes: PRKCA (r = 0.28, p
   = 0.076489), GRIN3A (r = −0.006, p = 0.966528).

   further analysis. (A) Heatmap showing genes involved in the amphetamine
   pathway from 1,022 probes with significantly different gene expression
   levels (using the R package “pheatmap”). (B) Correlation between FOS
   and other genes in the amphetamine pathway (FOSB, JUN, PRKCA, GRIA3,
   GRIN3A and CALM3). (C) Corrgram shows the correlation of FOS with other
   six genes in the amphetamine pathway. The cells of the matrix were
   shaded to show the correlation value. The correlation r-value between
   FOS and six genes in the amphetamine pathway were FOSB (r = 0.73, p =
   1.02E-07), JUN (r = 0.66, p = 0.000003) GRIA3 (r = 0.38, p = 0.014374),
   PRKCA (r = 0.28, p = 0.001441), GRIN3A (r = –0.006, p = 0.966528),
   CALM3 (r = –0.49, p = 0.001441), respectively.

   To overcome the limitations of individual studies, we validated our
   findings in dataset [109]GSE73129. The results showed a significant
   difference of FOS expression between schizophrenia and control
   lymphoblast samples. No differences were found in other genes involved
   in the AMPH pathway ([110]Figure 5A). The results from two GEO datasets
   [111]GSE62333 and [112]GSE73129 demonstrated up-regulated expression of
   FOS in fibroblast and lymphoblast samples from schizophrenia patients,
   which were involved in the AMPH pathway. These non-neural peripheral
   cells may be useful for studying molecular signatures in psychiatric
   disorders ([113]Cattane et al., 2015; [114]Horiuchi et al., 2016).
   Post-mortem brains are also valuable tools to identify molecular
   alterations in these diseases. To further address the role of FOS in
   schizophrenia pathogenesis, we analyzed human postmortem dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex samples and brain tissues of a schizophrenia
   22q11-deletion mouse model ([115]Stark et al., 2008; [116]Hagenauer et
   al., 2016). FOS gene expression was significantly down-regulated in CNS
   tissues, regardless of the source of postmortem tissue (UCDavis or
   UMichigan) or the region of mouse brain (prefrontal cortex or
   hippocampus) ([117]Figure 5B,C). To measure the predictive value of FOS
   in the datasets we used, ROC curves for FOS expression in schizophrenia
   samples and control samples were performed. The area under the curve
   (AUC) is 78.6% and 71.8% in [118]GSE62333 and [119]GSE73129 dataset,
   respectively. The AUC in [120]GSE92538 is 77.6% (UCDavis) and 79.4%
   (UMichigan), respectively. The AUC in [121]GSE10784 is 86.0%
   (prefrontal cortex) and 71.0% (hippocampus), respectively. The highest
   AUC was observed in the prefrontal cortex samples of [122]GSE10784
   dataset. These results suggested that FOS is acceptable as a biomarker
   of schizophrenia. Details were presented in [123]Figure 6.

   cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) samples from the Df(16)A+/–
   schizophrenia mouse model (P < 0.05).

   Collectively, our findings revealed that FOS, which is involved in the
   AMPH pathway, is significantly up-regulated in human fibroblast samples
   and can be validated in peripheral lymphoblast samples. Further
   analysis showed contrasting expression of FOS in CNS tissues. FOS was
   down-regulated in human postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   samples and brain tissues of a schizophrenia 22q11-deletion mouse
   model.

Discussion

   In this study, we performed a systematic search on the GEO database for
   microarray studies of schizophrenia with samples from patients’
   fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, post-mortem human brains, and brains from a
   mouse model of schizophrenia. Unlike previous studies, which analyzed
   peripheral or CNS samples only from schizophrenia patients, we
   identified FOS expression changes in different tissues. Skin
   fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and lymphoblasts are frequently used in
   schizophrenia gene expression analysis because of the difficulty in
   obtaining CNS tissues or cells from schizophrenia patients. Postmortem
   brains are another good source that help to address this problem. Our
   study, which analyzed FOS gene expression in peripheral and CNS
   tissues, provides a new window into the molecular changes underlying
   schizophrenia pathogenesis.

   In our analysis, we re-analyzed publicly available microarray gene
   expression data and obtained different conclusions. A previous study of
   GEO datasets [136]GSE62333 also reported the up-regulation of FOSB and
   FOS in the fibroblasts of schizophrenia patients and mainly focused on
   EGR1 and other genes as biomarkers for disease diagnosis ([137]Cattane
   et al., 2015). Our analysis focused on gene expression changes and
   related pathways contributing to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The
   analysis of the top 10 DEGs in schizophrenia and healthy samples
   revealed that FOS and FOSB (which are involved in the AMPH addiction
   pathway), were significantly up-regulated in schizophrenia fibroblast
   samples. Protein functional network analysis revealed proteins closely
   interacting with FOS that were also involved in the AMPH addiction
   pathway. These findings were consistent with our KEGG enrichment
   analysis results, which listed “AMPH addiction” as one of the top 10
   significantly enriched KEGG pathways. Additionally, Spearman
   correlation analyzing samples in dataset [138]GSE62333 indicated that
   FOS was positively correlated with FOSB, JUN, and GRIA3 in the AMPH
   pathway, and negatively correlated with CALM3 in the AMPH pathway.
   Thus, our results support previous findings and reveal a previously
   unrecognized pathway connected with FOS in the pathogenesis of
   schizophrenia.

   As one of the most studied immediate early genes in the brain, FOS is
   highly expressed in addiction to psychoactive drugs such as AMPH,
   alcohol, and cocaine ([139]Gallo et al., 2018). It also has been
   reported to be differentially expressed in schizophrenia samples,
   either through experimental or expression profiling studies ([140]Zuo
   et al., 2009; [141]Cattane et al., 2015; [142]Renard et al., 2016;
   [143]Monfil et al., 2018). Besides, FOS is thought to play an important
   role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia ([144]Zuo et al., 2009;
   [145]Renard et al., 2016; [146]Monfil et al., 2018). We observed that
   FOS expression was highly up-regulated in schizophrenia group of
   dataset [147]GSE62333 which was then validated in another dataset
   [148]GSE73129. ROC curves indicated fair predictive values of the
   datasets we analyzed. These combined results suggested FOS is
   acceptable as a biomarker of schizophrenia. Detection of FOS in blood
   samples may be helpful for schizophrenia diagnosis. Further exploration
   using postmortem human brains and 22q11-deletion mouse brain samples
   suggested that FOS is up-regulated in non-neural peripheral samples and
   down-regulated in brain tissues of schizophrenia patients compared with
   those of healthy controls. The alteration of FOS expression in
   peripheral and CNS tissues of schizophrenia indicates that this gene is
   sensitive for schizophrenia.

   Among the top 10 DEGs we detected, five of them (SNORA38B, SNORA68,
   SNORA23, SNORA20, and SNORA3A) were non-coding genes. The ratio of
   non-coding to protein-coding genes is considered a function of
   developmental complexity. Prokaryotes have less than 25% non-coding
   DNA, while humans have approximately 98.5% non-coding DNA. RNA-based
   regulation is devoted to the majority of advances in human genomic
   programming ([149]Mattick, 2004). Increasing evidence suggests that
   non-coding RNAs play an important role in neural development and
   function, and neurological disease progression ([150]Mehler and
   Mattick, 2006). Although non-coding RNAs such as small nucleolar RNAs
   (snoRNAs), microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs), have been
   studied in disease etiology ([151]Barry, 2014; [152]Lai et al., 2016),
   the involvement of SNORA38B, SNORA68, SNORA23, SNORA20, and SNORA3A in
   the pathogenesis of schizophrenia has yet to be reported. However,
   snoRNAs may play important roles in brain development and neurological
   disease progression ([153]Pang et al., 2006). Recent studies have
   indicated that snoRNAs are highly expressed in tumor cells and are
   involved in cell behavior and oncogenesis ([154]Williams and Farzaneh,
   2012; [155]Gong et al., 2017; [156]Zhou et al., 2017).

   Five of the top 10 DEGs were protein-coding genes (RANBP3L, ACTG2,
   MMP1, FOSB, and FOS). RANBP3L is a gene involved in detoxification
   which mediates bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-specific nuclear export
   of SMAD to terminate BMP signaling ([157]Chen et al., 2015). The
   involvement of RANBP3L in schizophrenia has yet to be reported, but
   exon microarray analysis of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   revealed up-regulation of this gene in alcoholism ([158]Manzardo et
   al., 2014). ACTG2 encodes gamma 2 enteric actin, which is a smooth
   muscle actin found in enteric tissues and is crucial for enteric muscle
   contraction ([159]Thorson et al., 2014; [160]Wangler et al., 2014;
   [161]Matera et al., 2016). ACTG2 has yet to be associated with
   schizophrenia. Another actin-coding gene, ACTG1, is associated with
   brain development and hearing loss ([162]Perrin et al., 2010; [163]Park
   et al., 2013). Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are involved in the
   degradation of basement membrane and extracellular matrix (ECM)
   components in physiological and pathological processes, such as tissue
   development, wound healing, and tumor invasiveness ([164]Poola et al.,
   2005). As a member of the MMP family, MMP1 encodes an enzyme that
   breaks down the ECM, and promotes tumor cell division and metastasis.
   Studies have shown that activator protein-1 (AP-1) genes FOS and JUN
   can regulate MMP1 gene expression in invasive tumors ([165]Poola et
   al., 2005; [166]Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006; [167]Baker et al., 2018).
   MMP-mediated ECM disruption is also involved in the pathogenesis of
   schizophrenia. MMP modulators may therefore be a potential therapeutic
   target for the treatment of schizophrenia ([168]Chopra et al., 2015).
   Besides, FOS proteins can dimerize with JUN proteins to form the
   transcription factor complex AP-1, which regulates cell proliferation,
   differentiation, and transformation ([169]Milde-Langosch, 2005). Few
   studies have reported functions of FOSB in the CNS. However, a
   truncated splice variant of FOSB named Delta-FOSB is involved in
   behavior and addiction to drugs ([170]Nestler, 2008; [171]Ruffle,
   2014). FOS was up-regulated in schizophrenia samples and is a
   recognized marker of neural activation ([172]Gallo et al., 2018).

   There are several limitations in our study. First, the gene expression
   profiles could be affected by many factors, such as differences in
   methodology and/or sample preparation, patient characteristics,
   platform, and data analysis ([173]Sullivan et al., 2006; [174]Mistry
   and Pavlidis, 2010; [175]Kumarasinghe et al., 2012; [176]Mistry et al.,
   2013). Studies on schizophrenia are often associated with small sample
   sizes which may result in low statistical power. Second, several
   studies reported that peripheral cells may not reflect the gene
   expression profile of the human brain. Furthermore, using postmortem
   brains to understand dynamic changes in disease progression and
   development of complications is challenging ([177]Rollins et al., 2010;
   [178]Tylee et al., 2013; [179]Cattane et al., 2015; [180]Horiuchi et
   al., 2016). Finally, confirmatory experiments and comparison of results
   with microarray gene expression modifications from re-analysis will
   enable validation of our results.

Conclusion

   To conclude, our results indicate that FOS was significantly
   up-regulated in schizophrenia fibroblast and lymphoblast samples.
   Exploration of FOS gene expression in CNS tissues revealed that this
   gene was largely down-regulated in datasets [181]GSE92538 and
   [182]GSE10784. The signatures we identified are consistent with current
   hypotheses of molecular dysfunction in schizophrenia, including
   alteration of the FOS gene and involvement of the AMPH addiction
   pathway. FOS and AMPH-related genes may thus represent novel biomarkers
   for diagnosis of schizophrenia in clinical practice.
