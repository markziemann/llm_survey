Toxotherapy and cancer risk reduction [[181]82, [146]83]. Although there are many genes that have been shown to be associated
   with cancer development [[182], the precise mechanism of STAT3
   acetylation may result in the DNA methylation and tumor suppressor gene
   re-expression of these genes [[183]  [[147]84, [148]85.
