Based on the provided abstract and sections from the scientific article, here's an examination of how pathway enrichment analysis was conducted:

1. **Tool Used for Pathway Enrichment Analysis:**  
   - The tool used is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

2. **Tool Version Number Provided:**  
   - Not described

3. **Gene Set Library Queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other):**  
   - The gene set library queried includes KEGG, as indicated by references to the "AMPH addiction pathway."

4. **Background Gene List Defined for Pathway Enrichment Analysis:**  
   - Not described

5. **Statistical Test Used for Enrichment Analysis:**  
   - The specific statistical test used is not detailed in the provided text.

6. **False Discovery Rate Correction Used to Control Number of False Positives:**  
   - It is mentioned that a "false discovery rate (FDR) correction" was used, indicating control over false positives.
