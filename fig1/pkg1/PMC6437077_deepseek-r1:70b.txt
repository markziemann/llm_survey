Alright, so I need to figure out how the pathway enrichment analysis was conducted in this scientific article. Let me go through the provided sections step by step.

First, I'll look at the Methods section because that's where such details are usually explained. The user mentioned focusing on the Methods but also other sections if needed.

Looking under "MeDIP-Seq" and the following subsections, there's a part titled "DMRs and DMGs Identify." In that section, after identifying DMRs and DMGs, it says they were analyzed with GO and KEGG pathways using the DAVID web server. So, I can note that the tools used for pathway enrichment are GO and KEGG via DAVID.

Now, checking if a tool version is provided. The text doesn't specify any version numbers for DAVID or other tools, so I think it's not described.

Next, regarding the gene set libraries queried, since they mention GO and KEGG, those are the two libraries used.

Was a background gene list defined? The article doesn't explicitly say if they used a specific background list. It just mentions annotating DMRs in gene level and using DAVID for GO and KEGG. So I'll put not described here.

Statistical test used: The section mentions that EdgeR was used to identify DEGs, but for the pathway enrichment itself, it doesn't specify which test was applied within DAVID. So again, this is not described.

Lastly, false discovery rate correction: There's no mention of any correction methods like FDR or p-value adjustments in the analysis, so I assume it wasn't described either.
