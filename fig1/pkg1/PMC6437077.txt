Abstract

   DNA methylation is an important form of epigenetic regulation that can
   regulate the expression of genes and the development of tissues. Muscle
   satellite cells play an important role in skeletal muscle development
   and regeneration. Therefore, the DNA methylation status of genes in
   satellite cells is important in the regulation of the development of
   skeletal muscle. This study systematically investigated the changes of
   genome-wide DNA methylation in satellite cells during skeletal muscle
   development. According to the MeDIP-Seq data, 52,809–123,317 peaks were
   obtained for each sample, covering 0.70–1.79% of the genome. The number
   of reads and peaks was highest in the intron regions followed by the
   CDS regions. A total of 96,609 DMRs were identified between any two
   time points. Among them 6198 DMRs were annotated into the gene promoter
   regions, corresponding to 4726 DMGs. By combining the MeDIP-Seq and
   RNA-Seq data, a total of 202 overlap genes were obtained between DMGs
   and DEGs. GO and Pathway analysis revealed that the overlap genes were
   mainly involved in 128 biological processes and 23 pathways. Among the
   biological processes, terms related to regulation of cell proliferation
   and Wnt signaling pathway were significantly different. Gene–gene
   interaction analysis showed that Wnt5a, Wnt9a, and Tgfβ1 were the key
   nodes in the network. Furthermore, the expression level of Wnt5a,
   Wnt9a, and Tgfβ1 genes could be influenced by the methylation status of
   promoter region during skeletal muscle development. These results
   indicated that the Wnt and Tgfβ signaling pathways may play an
   important role in functional regulation of satellite cells, and the DNA
   methylation status of Wnt and Tgfβ signals is a key regulatory factor
   during skeletal muscle development. This study provided new insights
   into the effects of genome-wide methylation on the function of
   satellite cells.

Introduction

   Skeletal muscle satellite cells are a kind of mononuclear cells with a
   flattened projection, which locate between the muscle fiber basement
   membrane and the muscle cell membrane in skeletal muscle ([36]Mauro,
   1961). Satellite cells play an important role in skeletal muscle
   development and regeneration ([37]Ono et al., 2015; [38]Gurevich et
   al., 2016; [39]Angelino et al., 2018; [40]Guitart et al., 2018).
   Satellite cells can undergo myogenic differentiation, thereby providing
   the nucleus for the attached muscle fibers and participating in the
   development of muscle fibers ([41]Alameddine et al., 1989). In adult
   skeletal muscle, satellite cells can be activated, and then undergo
   myogenic differentiation to form new muscle fibers or to fuse with
   myotubes to repair damaged areas, when muscle fibers are damaged
   ([42]Collins et al., 2005; [43]Guitart et al., 2018).

   Researches showed that the activation, proliferation, and
   differentiation of satellite cells play a critical role in skeletal
   muscle development, which require the involvement of a variety of
   signaling molecules, including TGF pathway ([44]Delaney et al., 2017),
   FGF pathway ([45]Han et al., 2012), and Wnt pathway ([46]Girardi and Le
   Grand, 2018). Studies showed that TGFβ1 could inhibit the proliferation
   of myoblasts and the regeneration of necrotic muscle fibers, and Wnt
   signaling could regulate the differentiation of myoblast by interacting
   with TGFβ signaling ([47]Melone et al., 1999; [48]Rudolf et al., 2016).
   In addition, our previous study showed that TGFβ and WNT9a could
   inhibit the differentiation of satellite cell, and the synergistic
   effects of TGFβ2, WNT9a, and FGFR4 signals could be involved in
   regulating the differentiation of satellite cells during skeletal
   muscle development ([49]Zhang et al., 2018). However, the epigenetic
   regulatory mechanism affecting the expression level of these key
   factors remain largely unknown.

   Methylation is a common form of epigenetic regulation affecting the
   expression of related genes and the development of tissue ([50]Gilsbach
   et al., 2014). The hypermethylation of promoter regions can lead to
   gene silencing, but the hypomethylated regions are usually an open area
   ([51]Bird, 1986; [52]Bernstein et al., 2007). In recent years, many
   studies have shown that methylation plays an important role in skeletal
   muscle development, in which satellite cells are involved. Histone
   methylation and DNA methylation are the two most common forms of
   methylation modification, and these two forms of methylation
   modification could effectively affect the function of satellite cells
   in skeletal muscle development ([53]Liu et al., 2013; [54]Miyata et
   al., 2017; [55]Robinson and Dilworth, 2018). Methylated Pax7 could
   directly bind to MLL1/2 protein and then recruited histone H3K4
   methyltransferase complex to regulate the expression of Myf5
   ([56]McKinnell et al., 2008; [57]Kawabe et al., 2012). The expression
   level of Myogenin was up-regulated during the differentiation of
   satellite cells on account of the decrease of the 5′-flanking
   methylation level ([58]Fuso et al., 2010). Methyl-CpG-binding protein,
   named CIBZ, could affect the methylation status of the
   promoter-proximal region of Myogenin gene and then inhibited its
   transcription level ([59]Oikawa et al., 2011). Although many studies
   have shown that methylation plays an important role in regulating the
   functions of satellite cells, the systematic exposition of the
   methylation profile of satellite cells in the process of skeletal
   muscle development is still very limited.

   Our group studied the transcriptome and differentiation characteristics
   of satellite cells at different developmental stages. We confirmed that
   the Wnt, Tgfβ, and Fgfr signals were responsible for the attenuation of
   satellite cell differentiation with development, but the mechanisms of
   expression change of key factors were unknown ([60]Zhang et al., 2018).
   Hence, in this study, mouse satellite cells from four time points were
   obtained. Furthermore, MeDIP-Seq analysis was performed to investigate
   the genome-wide temporal dynamic changes of DNA methylation during
   skeletal muscle development. This study systematically analyzed the DNA
   methylation profile of satellite cells in skeletal muscle development,
   and identified the potential effects of DNA methylation on skeletal
   muscle development.

Results

Global Mapping of DNA Methylation of Satellite Cells With the Postnatal
Development

   In our previous study, the skeletal muscle development of mice
   postnatal can be divided into four stages according to cluster
   analysis, namely, Weeks 2, 4 & 6, 8, and 10 & 12 ([61]Zhang et al.,
   2018). Therefore, the leg muscle of four different time points (Weeks
   2, 6, 8, and 12) was obtained to isolate satellite cells. Then the
   MeDIP-Seq analysis was performed. Firstly, we investigated the global
   DNA methylation status at different developmental stages. According to
   our data, 21 million clean reads per sample were obtained through
   filtering the raw reads. Furthermore, the clean reads were mapped to
   the mouse reference genome, and the mapping rates ranged from 95.74 to
   96.34% with uniquely mapped rates ranging from 36.05 to 45.36%
   ([62]Supplementary Table S1). The uniquely mapped reads were considered
   during further analysis. The result demonstrating that the global
   distribution of uniquely mapped reads (chromosomes 1–19 and X) was
   investigated for each sample ([63]Supplementary Figure S1).
   Furthermore, the coverage of different methylated models CG, CHG, and
   CHH were analyzed, demonstrating that the CG, CHG, and CHH sites with
   high methylation level account for a small proportion in genome-wide
   ([64]Figure 1 and [65]Supplementary Figures S2–[66]S4).

   Proportion of the methylated CG, CHG, and CHH sites under different
   enrichment level of reads in different samples. The average value of
   each stage was considered.

   Usually, methylation peak is an important index for the study of
   differential methylation sites genome-wide. In our study,
   52,809–123,317 peaks were obtained for each sample, covering 0.70–1.79%
   of the genome ([69]Supplementary Table S2). To further investigate the
   genome-wide distribution of methylation data, the proportion of reads
   peaks in different genome components was calculated in six different
   regions. The result showed that the distribution of reads and peaks in
   CDS regions was second only to intron regions ([70]Figure 2A,B).
   Furthermore, the specific pattern of gene body was investigated. We
   divided each gene into 60 equal windows, and the upstream and
   downstream 2 kb regions were split into 20 non-overlapping windows. The
   result showed that the reads at the transcription start site (TSS)
   obviously decreased in all samples but gradually increased in the
   intragenic region ([71]Figure 2C). Moreover, the proportion of reads
   and peaks in CpG island was counted. The result showed that the
   distribution of reads and peaks in CpG island was lower than that
   outside CpG island regions ([72]Figure 2D,E and [73]Supplementary
   Figure S5).

Differential Methylation Regions and Differential Methylation Gene
Identification

   The methylation data was further explored to compare the differential
   methylation regions (DMRs) between any two time points (Week 2 versus
   Week 6, Week 2 versus Week 8, Week 2 versus Week 12, Week 6 versus Week
   8, Week 6 versus Week 12, and Week 8 versus Week 12). According to the
   data, a total of 96,609 DMRs were identified (p < 0.01). Among them,
   6198 DMRs were annotated into the gene promoter regions
   ([76]Supplementary Table S3). In this study, we considered the genes
   with methylation peaks in the promoter regions as the methylated genes.
   A total of 4726 differential methylation genes (DMGs) were identified
   ([77]Supplementary Table S4), and then clustering analysis was
   performed. The result showed that the methylation status of genes in
   satellite cells was a dynamic process with the development of skeletal
   muscle ([78]Supplementary Figure S6).

Functional Clustering Analysis of Overlap Genes Between DMGs and DEGs

   Studies showed that the methylation of promoter regions could affect
   gene expression ([79]Niemann et al., 2008; [80]Laurent et al., 2010).
   To further understand the effects of methylation on gene function and
   expression, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were compared
   between any two time points, and the union set of DEGs in any
   comparison group were considered. A total of 1717 DEGs were identified
   (FDR < 0.05) ([81]Supplementary Table S4). Furthermore, overlap
   analysis was performed between DEGs and DMGs, and a total of 202 genes
   were obtained ([82]Figure 3A and [83]Supplementary Table S4). The
   result indicated that changes in the expression levels of these genes
   might be influenced by methylation. Furthermore, the cluster analysis
   result showed that most genes had a lower methylation level at Week 2,
   and the methylation level of overlap genes was most significantly
   different between Weeks 2 and 12 ([84]Figure 3B).

   (A) The number of overlap genes between DMGs and DEGs is shown by a
   Venn diagram. (B) Cluster analysis of overlap genes between DMGs and
   DEGs according to the methylation levels of genes. Red indicated
   hypermethylation levels and purple indicated hypomethylation levels.

   In addition, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed using the DAVID
   program. The result showed that these overlap genes were mainly
   involved in 128 biological processes (p < 0.05). The top 30 GO terms
   were showed in [87]Figure 4A, including positive regulation of cell
   migration, positive regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation, Wnt
   signaling pathway, calcium modulating pathway, and regulation of cell
   proliferation. To further understand the role of DMGs in the functional
   regulation of satellite cells, signaling pathways were analyzed using
   the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database (KEGG). The result
   showed that the overlap genes were enriched in 23 signaling pathways (p
   < 0.05), some of which were related to muscle development, including
   Calcium signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, and Insulin secretion
   ([88]Figure 4B). These results indicated that the DNA methylation
   status in satellite cells plays an important role in the development of
   skeletal muscle.

Wnt5a, Wnt9a, and Tgfβ1 Were the Key Nodes in the Gene Interaction Network

   To identify the potential key genes that can regulate the function of
   satellite cells with skeletal muscle development, overlap genes between
   DMGs and DEGs were selected to study the interaction using String
   software. A total of 52 genes were considered in the network after
   filtering genes with weak interaction strength (confidence >0.7)
   ([91]Figure 5). The network revealed that Wnt5a, Wnt9a, Tgfβ1, Cxcl12,
   Mmp14, Cdh5, and Egr1 were the core nodes. In addition, Tgfβ1 had the
   largest number of interactive genes in the network. Moreover, Wnt
   signaling pathway, including Wnt5a, Wnt9a, Fzd2, and Ror2 genes, was
   located in the upstream of the interaction network and could regulate
   Mmp4, Cdh5, and Egr1 indirectly through the Cxcl12 gene. This result
   indicated that Wnt5a, Wnt9a, and Tgfβ1 were the key nodes in the gene
   interaction network and that the methylation status of Wnt and Tgfβ
   signaling pathways may play an important role in functional regulation
   of satellite cells during skeletal muscle development.

DNA Methylation Could Regulate the Expression of Wnt5a, Wnt9a, and Tgfβ1
Genes at Transcription Level

   In order to study the effect of DNA methylation on gene expression
   level, the trend of gene expression with that of methylation was
   compared, using FPKM of RNA-seq data and MeDIP-seq data, respectively.
   The result showed that, the expression trends of Wnt5a and Tgfβ1 genes
   were consistent with those of DNA methylation level, which were
   gradually up-regulated with development ([94]Figure 6A,C). Furthermore,
   Q-PCR result showed that the expression level of Wnt5a and Tgfβ1 genes
   were up-regulated with development ([95]Figure 6B,D). However, the DNA
   methylation level in the promoter region of Wnt9a gene was
   down-regulated at Week 6, but significantly up-regulated at Weeks 8 and
   12, contrary to the change trend of expression level ([96]Figure 6E).
   Furthermore, Q-PCR result showed that the expression level of Wnt9a
   gene was significantly up-regulated at Week 6, but down-regulated from
   Weeks 8 to 12 ([97]Figure 6F). These results indicated that the
   expression level of Wnt5a, Wnt9a, and Tgfβ1 genes could be influenced
   by the methylation state of promoter region during skeletal muscle
   development.

   samples were analyzed for each treatment, and the results were
   presented as the mean ± SEM. ^∗P < 0.05, ^∗∗P < 0.01.

Discussion

   Skeletal muscle satellite cells are a class of stem cells located
   between the myofibril membrane and the myofibril basement membrane, and
   they can participate in the development and regeneration of muscle
   fibers ([100]Charge and Rudnicki, 2004; [101]Lepper et al., 2011). In
   our previous studies, the capacity of the differentiation of satellite
   cells decreased with age, and Weeks 4 and 6 were two similar stages of
   development, as well as Weeks 10 and 12. Moreover, we confirmed that
   many genes and pathways related to growth and development were involved
   in this process through transcriptome analysis ([102]Zhang et al.,
   2018). Therefore, we isolated skeletal muscle satellite cells from mice
   of different ages for MeDIP-Seq analysis to study the expression change
   mechanism of related genes during skeletal muscle development. In this
   study, only four time points were selected to represent the development
   of skeletal muscle postnatal for the law of skeletal muscle development
   shown in our previous article. In addition, from Day 1 to Week 2 are
   the early stages of growth and development after birth. Considering the
   operability, satellite cells of Week 2 mice were selected as the
   representative of early stages.

   According to the MeDIP-Seq data, 21 million clean reads per sample were
   obtained by filtering the raw reads. The rate of uniquely mapped ranged
   from 36.05 to 45.36% ([103]Supplementary Table S1). Studies have shown
   that methylation peak was an important index of the methylation level
   ([104]Li et al., 2010; [105]Su et al., 2016). Generally, promoter
   regions have lower methylation levels than other regions ([106]Laurent
   et al., 2010; [107]Li et al., 2014). In our study, the genome-wide
   coverage of peaks was 0.70–1.79%, and the promoter region had a lower
   methylation level than other regions ([108]Figure 2). Moreover, the
   proportion of peaks in CpG island regions was lower than that outside
   CpG island regions due to the small proportion of CpG island regions in
   genome-wide.

   Researches showed that DNA methylation in promoter regions could
   inhibit the gene expression, namely high methylation levels correspond
   to low expression levels ([109]Wagner et al., 2014; [110]Wu and Zhang,
   2014). In the present study, a total of 96,609 DMRs were annotated into
   the gene promoter regions, and these corresponded to 4726 DMGs.
   Moreover, the 202 overlap genes were identified by comparing DMGs and
   DEGs. Most of the genes were related to satellite cell function and
   muscle development, including positive regulation of cell migration,
   positive regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation, Wnt signaling
   pathway, calcium modulating pathway, and regulation of cell
   proliferation. Cluster analysis revealed that many of the overlap genes
   had a lower methylation levels at Week 2 ([111]Figure 3B). This result
   indicated that these genes were transcriptionally activated at early
   stages due to related to the growth and development processes of
   tissues. Studies showed that dynamics in DNA methylation persisted
   during development and cell differentiation ([112]Stelzer et al., 2016;
   [113]Li et al., 2018). Interestingly, the changes of methylation levels
   of the overlap genes was not linear in these four developmental stages,
   indicating that these genes may be involved in different biological
   processes due to the developmental characteristics at the different
   stages of skeletal muscle development.

   Furthermore, signaling pathway analysis was performed. As expected, we
   found that Wnt signaling pathway was significantly enriched. Researches
   have shown that Wnt and Tgfβ signaling pathway play important roles in
   skeletal muscle development regulation ([114]Biressi et al., 2014;
   [115]Zhu et al., 2017; [116]Girardi and Le Grand, 2018; [117]Zhang et
   al., 2018). Gene–gene interaction analysis showed that Wnt5a, Wnt9a,
   and Tgfβ1 were the key nodes in the network. Previous study showed that
   WNT5a could promote the proliferation of skeletal muscle satellite
   cells ([118]Otto et al., 2008). Studies showed that TGFβ1 could inhibit
   the proliferation of myoblasts and the regeneration of myofiber
   ([119]Melone et al., 1999; [120]Delaney et al., 2017). In addition, our
   previous study has shown that Wnt and Tgfβ signals could regulate the
   differentiation of satellite cells. The synergistic effects of TGFβ2,
   WNT9a, and FGFR4 signals could regulate the differentiation of
   satellite cells, and WNT9a acted as an intermediate regulator in this
   equilibrium system ([121]Zhang et al., 2018). Moreover, we also found
   that Acvrl1 and Mstn, which are members of Tgfβ superfamily
   ([122]McPherron et al., 1997; [123]Humbert, 2002), also occurred in the
   interaction network ([124]Figure 5). Studies showed that MSTN could
   inhibit the differentiation of myoblasts ([125]Guardiola et al., 2012;
   [126]Rossi et al., 2016). Combining results from our study and those in
   these researches, we concluded that DNA methylation could affect the
   function of satellite cells during skeletal muscle development process
   in mice.

   Researches have shown that DNA methylation in promoter regions was
   related to the silence of gene, while the effect of DNA methylation in
   gene body regions on gene expression was variable ([127]Gelfman et al.,
   2013; [128]Wu and Zhang, 2014; [129]Yang et al., 2014). In this study,
   we focused on the DNA methylation of promoter regions. Study showed
   that hypermethylation of promoter regions could inhibit the expression
   of Wnt9a gene, which consisted with the result in this study
   ([130]Figure 6) ([131]Shu et al., 2006). Interestingly, the methylation
   level in the promoter region of Wnt5a and Tgfβ1 genes showed positive
   correlation with their expression level. Therefore, we speculated that
   the methylation of promoter regions cooperated with that of the gene
   body regions to regulate the expression of Wnt5a and Tgfβ1 genes.
   Hence, we concluded that Wnt and Tgfβ signaling pathways were the key
   regulators during skeletal muscle development, and their DNA
   methylation status may be the key factor on functional regulation of
   satellite cell.

Conclusion

   The DNA methylation in satellite cells dynamically changed during
   skeletal muscle development, which may affect the expression of genes
   and regulate the function of satellite cells. The DNA methylation
   status of Wnt and Tgfβ signals is a key factor on functional regulation
   of skeletal muscle satellite cell development. This study provides
   evidence for epigenetic studies of skeletal muscle development. Such
   information is potentially useful for improving the muscle growth of
   livestock.

Materials and Methods

Mice

   All C57BL/6 mice used in this study were obtained from Hubei Center for
   Disease Control and Prevention (Wuhan, China). All experiments were
   performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of
   Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources,
   Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council, 1996). The
   protocols were approved by the Hubei Province Committee on Laboratory
   Animal Care (HZAUMU2013-0005).

Tissue and Cell

   Satellite cells were isolated from the hind-limb muscle tissues at four
   different time points (postnatal Weeks 2, 6, 8, and 12), and 8 ∼ 12
   mice (8 mice for Weeks 2 and Week 6, 10 mice for Week 8, and 12 mice
   for Week 12) were used for each cell isolation experiment. Satellite
   cell isolation method referred that described in previous study
   ([132]Lu et al., 2008; [133]Zhang et al., 2018). The muscle tissues
   were digested for 60–90 min with collagenase I (2 mg/mL) (Sigma, United
   States, C1639) at 37°C. The dissociated suspension was sifted through
   100, 200, and 400 mesh sieves. Then, the suspension was washed with
   RPMI 1640 medium, re-suspended by growth medium with 15% fetal calf
   serum (Gibco, United States, 10082-147), chick embryo extract (GEMINI,
   United States, 100-163p), basic fibroblast growth factor (Life, United
   States, 13256-029) (0.25 μg/100 mL), and RPMI 1640 medium. The
   suspension was plated on a normal dish and then transferred to a dish
   coated with matrigel (BD, United States, 356234) after 2.5 h. The
   satellite cells were cultured at 37°C in a cell incubator with 5% CO[2]
   until they converged to 60%. Then, the second differential attachment
   experiment was performed.

RNA-Seq and Data Analysis

   The sequencing process and analysis methods used were in accordance
   with those used in our previous research ([134]Zhang et al., 2018). The
   total RNA was extracted from isolated satellite cells at six different
   time points using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany, 74106) in
   accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Qualified total RNA
   was further purified by using the RNAClean XP Kit (Beckman Coulter,
   Inc., Kraemer Boulevard Brea, CA, United States, A63987) and the
   RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN, Germany, 79254). RNA and the library
   preparation integrity were verified with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100
   (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States). We accomplished
   the cluster and first dimension sequencing primer hybridization on cBot
   of Illumina sequencing machine in accordance with the cBot User Guide.
   Sequencing was performed by Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation (P.R.C).
   Edger, which is an R package, was used to screen the DEGs.

MeDIP-Seq

   DNA was isolated from cultured satellite cells using OMEGA TISSUE DNA
   Kit (2000) (n = 3 for each time point). The concentration and quality
   of DNA were assessed by NanoDrop^® ND-1000 and agarose gel
   electrophoresis. The library was prepared according to MeDIP library
   development flow. Sequencing was performed by SHANGHAI BIOTECHNOLOGY
   CORPORATION. The amount of DNA used for sequencing was about 2 μg. The
   sequencing process included the following: (1) Library construction was
   performed and the integrity was verified with Agilent 2100 (Agilent
   Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States). (2) Cluster generation
   and primer hybridization were completed on the cBot equipped with the
   Illumina HiSeq sequencing instrument according to the corresponding
   process shown in the cBot User Guide. (3) The sequencing process was
   controlled by data collection software provided by Illumina, and
   real-time data analysis was carried out.

Analysis of MeDIP-Seq Data

   Raw sequencing data were first filtered with the following five steps:
   (a) Reads with >50% bases having phred quality < 20 were removed; (b)
   Removal of the bases with phred quality < 20 in 3′ end; (c) Removal of
   adapter contained in reads; (d) Removal of reads with length < 20; (e)
   Removal of reads that contain ‘N’ base.

   Clean reads were aligned to the Ensembl mouse reference genome
   (GRCm38^[135]1) using BWA (Version 0.7.17) with default parameters
   ([136]Li and Durbin, 2009). To investigate the general model of
   methylation, we analyzed the distribution of aligned reads on the whole
   reference genome, CGIs, and gene regions, as well as the genome
   coverage of CG, CHG, and CHH regions with different sequencing depths
   in each sample and group. The peak distribution was analyzed using MACS
   (version 2.1.1) software in different genome components, including
   upstream 2 kb, 5′ UTR, CDS, intron, 3′ UTR, downstream 2 kb, and CpG
   islands ([137]Zhang et al., 2008).

DMRs and DMGs Identify

   EdgeR integrated in the R packages MEDIPS with 200 bp window size was
   used to identify DMRs between different groups ([138]Lienhard et al.,
   2014). MEDIPS identified DMRs between groups by calculating Wilcoxon
   rank tests for the reads per million (rpm) values of each window (cite
   MEDIPS). DMRs were filtered for windows with p < 0.01. Further,
   ChIPseeker was performed to annotate the DMRs in gene level, and only
   the genes with promoter annotated by DMRs were defined as differential
   methylated genes (DMGs) ([139]Yu et al., 2015). All DMGs were
   subsequently analyzed with GO and KEGG pathway of the DAVID web server
   ([140]Huang da et al., 2009).

Q-PCR

   Reverse transcription was performed to initiate cDNA synthesis by using
   the Prime Script^TM RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TAKARA BIO INC,
   Otsu, Shiga, Japan). THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (TOYOBO, Japan) was used
   for Q-PCR, and the results were monitored using a CFX384 Real-Time PCR
   Detection System (Bio-Rad, United States). The sequences for Q-PCR
   primer were as follow: Wnt9a-F, 5′GATTTGCGAGCCCGAGTG3′, Wnt9a-R,
   5′GTCTCATATTTGTGTTTTAGGTGCTT3′; Wnt5a-F, 5′CTCACCCCCACAGGCAAC3′,
   Wnt5a-R, 5′TGCCCTACCAGCAGTGAGTG3′; Tgfβ1-F, 5′GGCGGTGCTCGCTTTGTA3′,
   Tgfβ1-R, 5′TCCCGAATGTCTGACGTATTGA3′.
