Abstract

   Tissue-resident CD8^+ memory T (TRM) cells are immune cells that
   permanently reside at tissue sites where they play an important role in
   providing rapid protection against reinfection. They are not only
   phenotypically and functionally distinct from their circulating memory
   counterparts, but also exhibit a unique transcriptional profile. To
   date, the local tissue signals required for their development and
   long-term residency are not well understood. So far, the
   best-characterised tissue-derived signal is transforming growth
   factor-β (TGF-β), which has been shown to promote the development of
   these cells within tissues. In this study, we aimed to determine to
   what extent the transcriptional signatures of TRM cells from multiple
   tissues reflects TGF-β imprinting. We activated murine CD8^+ T cells,
   stimulated them in vitro by TGF-β, and profiled their transcriptomes
   using RNA-seq. Upon comparison, we identified a TGF-β-induced signature
   of differentially expressed genes between TGF-β-stimulated and
   -unstimulated cells. Next, we linked this in vitro TGF-β-induced
   signature to a previously identified in vivo TRM-specific gene set and
   found considerable (>50%) overlap between the two gene sets, thus
   showing that a substantial part of the TRM signature can be attributed
   to TGF-β signalling. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis further
   revealed that the altered gene signature following TGF-β exposure
   reflected transcriptional signatures found in TRM cells from both
   epithelial and non-epithelial tissues. In summary, these findings show
   that TGF-β has a broad footprint in establishing the residency-specific
   transcriptional profile of TRM cells, which is detectable in TRM cells
   from diverse tissues. They further suggest that constitutive TGF-β
   signaling might be involved for their long-term persistence at tissue
   sites.

Introduction

   TRM cells are a recently identified subset of memory T cells that
   reside in peripheral tissues without re-entering circulation
   [[37]1–[38]4]. TRM cells have been identified in a number of barrier
   and neuronal tissues including the skin, lung, gut, liver, female
   reproductive tract, and brain, where they have been shown to offer
   superior protection against local re-infection compared to their
   circulating central (TCM) and effector memory (TEM) CD8^+ T cell
   counterparts [[39]2,[40]3,[41]5–[42]9]. TRM cells that localise to the
   epithelial and neuronal tissues commonly express the cell surface
   molecule CD103 (integrin αE), which is thought to promote TRM
   persistence through adhesive interactions with epithelial
   cell-expressed E-cadherin [[43]3,[44]10–[45]14]. However, the local
   tissue-derived signals that instruct and control the development and
   persistence of TRM cells at tissue sites are not completely understood.
   Understanding the mechanisms underlying these processes, which provide
   rapid and enhanced site-specific immunity, have the potential to enable
   rational vaccine design.

   The role of cytokines in the differentiation and maintenance of
   circulating memory T cell subsets is well documented [[46]15,[47]16],
   and there are established links between local tissue-derived cytokines
   and tissue residency [[48]8,[49]11,[50]12,[51]17–[52]19]. In
   particular, TGF-β activity is critical for the development of CD8^+
   CD103^+ TRM cells in the skin, gut and lungs, although TGF-β
   -independent TRM cells have been described during protracted bacterial
   infection in intestinal mucosa
   [[53]8,[54]11,[55]12,[56]17,[57]18,[58]20]. For example, studies have
   shown that TRM cells with defective TGF-β receptors, which are unable
   to respond to TGF-β signals, do not up-regulate CD103 expression and
   are incapable of maintaining residency at tissue sites
   [[59]8,[60]11,[61]12,[62]17,[63]18].

   It has recently been shown that mouse CD8^+ CD103^+ TRM cells isolated
   from skin, gut, and lung share a TRM-related transcriptional program,
   suggesting a common molecular machinery underlying their development,
   maintenance, and possibly function in peripheral tissues [[64]12].
   However, the role of TGF-β in shaping the TRM cell transcriptome, in
   particular, the shared TRM-related gene signature has not been
   elucidated. In this study, we sought to determine to what degree the
   previously identified common, tissue-independent TRM-related gene
   profile [[65]12], hereafter referred to as “TRM-related signature”, can
   be attributed to TGF-β signalling. To do so, we used RNA-sequencing to
   profile the transcriptome of murine CD8^+ T cells stimulated in vitro
   by TGF-β. First, to identify a TGF-β specific gene signature, we
   compared the transcriptome of in vitro TGF-β-stimulated activated CD8^+
   T cells to unstimulated cells. We then compared this in vitro
   TGF-β-induced transcriptional signature to the TRM-related signature in
   vivo and found a substantial overlap in their transcriptional profiles,
   thus providing new insights into the central role of TGF-β signalling
   in shaping the transcriptional program of TRM cells from both barrier
   and non-barrier tissues.

Methods

Mice

   Female C57BL/6 (wild-type [WT] B6) and gBT-I mice on C57BL/6
   background, between the ages of 8 and 15 weeks, were used in this study
   and were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in
   the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne.
   The gBT-I mice express a transgenic T cell receptor that recognises the
   herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein B (gB) peptide [[66]21]. All
   animal experiments were approved by The University of Melbourne Animal
   Ethics Committee.

Flow cytometry analysis

   The suspension of gBT-I cells were stained for 15 min at 4ºC with the
   following fluorescence-conjugated antibodies for flow cytometry:
   anti-CD45.1 (A20), anti-vα2 (B20.1), anti-CD8α (53–6.7), anti-CD103
   (2E7), all obtained from BD Pharmingen or eBioscience. Dead cells were
   excluded using propidium iodide or DAPI staining. Cells were analysed
   using the BD FACSAria flow cytometer at the Melbourne Cytometry
   ImmunoID Flow Cytometry facility (The University of Melbourne). Flow
   cytometry data were analysed using the FlowJo software (TreeStar).

In vitro cell culture and RNA extraction

   The in vitro culture system utlised in this study has been described
   previously [[67]3,[68]22]. Briefly, one gBT-I and one B6 spleen was
   harvested and processed into single cell suspensions by passing them
   through a 70 μm mesh. The B6 cells were coated with gB peptide (100
   μg/ml) in 4ml RP-10 (complete RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal calf serum) per
   spleen at 37°C for 15 minutes, washed and taken up in RP-10 with 2
   mg/ml of lipopolysaccharide (L4391, Sigma). 5ml of B6 splenocyte
   suspension was added to gBT-I splenocytes from ½ spleen in 35 ml RP-10
   per T75 flask. On day 2, 3, and 4 the cultured cells were expanded with
   500 U/ml of recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2). On day 5, the
   activated gBT-I cells were seeded at 12 million/5ml RP-10 and
   stimulated with or without 3 ng/ml of TGF-β for 40h in four conditions:
   Unstimulated, TGF-β, IL-2 or IL-2/TGF-β. The experiment was repeated
   three times, for three independent biological replicates. A total of 12
   samples were prepared.

   Total RNA was extracted from each sample by adding 200μl chloroform per
   1mL TRIzol directly to cells, vortexing briefly, and incubating at room
   temperature for 5 minutes. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000g for
   20 minutes at 4°C. The colourless upper aqueous layer was transferred
   to a new tube containing 500μl of Propan-2-ol, kept at room temperature
   for 10 minutes, and then centrifuged at 12,000g for 20 minutes. The
   supernatant was removed, RNA pellet was washed with 1ml of 75% ethanol,
   and the samples were centrifuged at 7,500g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
   Following the removal of the supernatant, the RNA pellet was air dried
   no longer than 5 minutes, and then resuspended in 20μl of sodium
   citrate dissolved in RNase-free water. DNA digestion with DNase-I was
   carried out with the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, CA).

DNA library construction, RNA sequencing, and data pre-processing

   Library preparation and sequencing were both performed by the
   Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF; Melbourne, Australia). All
   12 RNA samples were processed with the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA
   sample prep protocol to make cDNA libraries. The resulting normalised
   and pooled libraries were clustered on the Illumina cBot cluster
   amplification system using the HiSeq PE Cluster Kit v4 reagents
   followed by sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 system with the HiSeq
   SBS Kit v4 reagents. Base calling and quality scoring were done with
   the standard Illumina pipeline, Real-Time Analysis (RTA) version
   1.18.64 software. De-multiplexed raw FASTQ files containing 100bp PE
   reads were generated using Illumina’s bcl2fastq version 1.8.4 pipeline.
   The qualities of the raw sequence reads were assessed using FastQC
   version 0.11.3 [[69]23]. Based on the quality reports, read trimming
   was not required (Phred score > 35).

RNA-seq analysis

   The 100bp paired-end reads were aligned to the mouse (mm10) reference
   genome using Tophat2 version 2.1.1 [[70]24]. All mappings were
   performed with the default options, except the mate pair inner distance
   and standard deviation parameters, which were set to 0 and 65,
   respectively. The alignment for each biological replicate was performed
   independently, and only reads that mapped uniquely as pairs were
   retained for downstream analysis. Transcript assembly and
   quantification was carried out with Cufflinks2 version 2.2.1 [[71]25].
   Gene-level abundance was expressed as fragments per kilobase of exons
   per million fragments mapped (FPKM) values. An FPKM > 0.3 cut-off was
   applied to remove lowly expressed genes. Differential gene expression
   analysis was performed using Cuffdiff2 version 2.2.1 [[72]26], which
   employs a beta negative binomial distribution model to capture fragment
   count uncertainty and overdispersion (variability across biological
   replicates), and uses a sampling-based approach to statistically test
   for differences in gene abundance between groups. Three comparisons
   were made: (1) TGF-β vs. Untreated, (2) IL-2/TGF-β vs. Untreated, and
   (3) IL-2/TGF-β vs. IL-2. Genes with Benjamini and Hochberg [[73]27]
   adjusted P-values < 0.05 were considered as significantly
   differentially expressed (DE) in each comparison. Genes DE with FPKM
   values higher or lower in the TGF-β-treated groups than those in the
   TGF-β-untreated groups were defined as “up-” and “down-regulated”
   genes, respectively.

Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes

   We first identified the overlapping DE genes in the three comparisons.
   To explore the biological processes in which the subset of common DE
   genes were involved, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of genes
   up- and down-regulated in the TGF-β-treated groups was performed using
   GOrilla [[74]28], with 23,997 annotated genes in the Mus musculus
   genome (UCSC version mm10) provided as the background set. GO terms
   significant at FDR < 0.05 were then summarised into representative
   terms based on semantic similarity using REVIGO [[75]29]. Summarisation
   analysis was performed using the RELSIM semantic similarity measure
   with a medium similarity cut-off (C = 0.7) on genes from Mus musculus.

Enrichment analysis of TRM-related gene signature

   To gain insight into the role of TGF-β in influencing the
   transcriptional signature of TRM cells, we tested whether a previously
   defined core TRM-related signature [[76]12] was also differentially
   expressed in our three comparisons of TGF-β-stimulated to -unstimulated
   cells. This core signature comprises 37 genes that were identified as
   commonly DE in murine TRM cells from skin, gut, lung with respect to
   their circulating spleen (TEM and TCM cells) counterparts [[77]12].
   Since the genes in the TRM-related signature were profiled on a
   microarray-based platform (Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0ST arrays), only 35
   core TRM-related signature genes common to both platforms (RNA-seq vs.
   microarray) were considered. These 35 genes were compared to the DE
   gene list obtained in each of three TGF-β-treated vs. TGF-β-untreated
   comparisons and the degree of overlap was determined. Only genes
   differentially expressed in the same direction in both studies were
   considered as overlapping. Bootstrapping was further performed to
   evaluate the statistical significance of the observed overlap. A total
   of 10,000 bootstraps were performed. For each bootstrap, the
   intersection between k and m[i] genes randomly selected (with
   replacement) was calculated, where k was the number of genes in the
   TRM-related signature (N = 35) and m[i] was the number of genes DE in
   comparison i. The enrichment P-value was calculated as the probability
   of an overlap being greater than or equal to the observed overlap.

   Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was further carried out to test the
   enrichment of 10 previously identified tissue-specific TRM
   transcriptional signatures (Table A in [78]S1 Table) against the ranked
   list of genes DE between TGF-β-treated vs. TGF-β-untreated groups using
   the GSEA version 2.2.3 software downloaded from the Broad Institute
   website ([79]http://www.broadinstitute.com/gsea/index.jsp) [[80]30].
   The predefined TRM cell-associated gene sets analysed included genes
   previously identified as significantly DE (|log2FC| > 1.5) in TRM cells
   isolated from skin, gut, lung, brain, and liver [[81]12,[82]31,[83]32].
   Briefly, the skin, gut, lung TRM associated gene sets comprised genes
   previously reported as either up- or down- regulated in murine CD103^+
   CD8^+ T cells from skin, gut, or lungs after infection with HSV,
   lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or influenza virus, respectively,
   when compared to their circulating HSV-specific TCM and TEM
   counterparts [[84]12]. The brain TRM associated gene sets have been
   previously reported to be up- and down-regulated in mouse brain CD103^+
   CD8^+ T cells relative to splenic CD103^− CD8^+ T cells following
   vesicular stomatitis virus infection [[85]31]. Likewise, genes
   previously identified as up- and down-regulated in murine liver TRM
   cells (CD69^+ KLRG1^low) vs. spleen TEM cells (CD69^– KLRG1^high),
   following immunisation radiation-attenuated sporozoites (malaria
   vaccine), were used as liver TRM cell-associated gene sets [[86]32].
   The list of genes DE between HSV-specific TCM or TEM cells and naive T
   cells was used as a negative control gene set (Table A in [87]S1
   Table).

   Enrichment analysis was performed on standardised, log2-transformed
   FPKM values for 10,941 expressed genes (FPKM > 0.3) across the 12
   samples. First, GSEA ranked all the genes differentially expressed
   between the TGF-β-treated vs. TGF-β-untreated groups by expression fold
   change using the ‘Signal2Noise’ ranking metric, which scales the mean
   expression within each group by their respective standard deviation.
   This resulted in a list of genes sorted according to their association
   with TGF-β treatment, with the most up-regulated genes at the top end
   and the most down-regulated genes at the lower end. Next, the genes in
   the predefined gene set were tested for their overrepresentation at the
   top (or bottom) end of the ranked list. An Enrichment Score (ES)
   defined the degree of enrichment [[88]30]. The enrichment P-values were
   computed by running 100,000 permutations of phenotype labels. Gene sets
   significant at the standard GSEA cut-off: a nominal P-value < 0.05 and
   FDR q-value < 0.25, were defined as significantly enriched.

Results

Experimental design and analysis of the RNA-seq data

   As outlined in the experimental design workflow ([89]Fig 1A), RNA
   samples were harvested from in vitro activated murine gBT-I cells that
   were stimulated with or without TGF-β in the presence or absence of
   IL-2. Prior to TGF-β stimulation, flow cytometry revealed the cell
   culture was highly enriched in activated CD8^+ gBT-I T cell population
   ([90]Fig 1B). During the incubation with TGF-β, the experiment included
   conditions with exogenous pro-survival cytokine IL-2 to mitigate any
   potential negative effects on cell survival in vitro within the 40h
   stimulation period. Three biological replicate samples were obtained
   for each TGF-β-stimulated (TGF-β; IL-2/TGF-β) and TGF-β-unstimulated
   (Untreated; IL-2) groups. A total of 12 RNA-seq libraries were prepared
   and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform at depths of 19.8–24.6
   million 100 bp PE reads per sample (Table B in [91]S1 Table). Read
   mapping, transcriptome assembly, gene-level quantification, and
   differential expression analysis were performed using the
   Tophat2/Cufflinks2/Cuffdiff2 pipeline as detailed in Methods ([92]S1
   Fig). Quality assessment of the raw reads with the FastQC tool [[93]23]
   reported high quality reads with average quality (Phred) score greater
   than 35 for all the libraries. Across all libraries, paired-end read
   alignment rates to the mm10 mouse genome were high (range: 85.1–86.9%
   uniquely mapped reads) (Table B in [94]S1 Table).

   (A) On day 0, wild type C57BL/6 splenocytes were coated with gB peptide
   and cocultured with gBT-I splenocytes in order to specifically activate
   gB-specific CD8^+ T cells. Addition of IL-2 on days 2, 3, and 4
   maintains T cell proliferation. At day 5, a highly pure population of
   activated CD8^+ gBT-I T cells was subjected to four conditions:
   unstimulated control, TGF-β, IL-2, and TGF-β/IL-2. After 40h of TGF-β
   stimulation, cells were subjected to RNA extraction and RNA sequencing;
   N = 3 independent experiments. (B) Flow cytometric analysis of
   activated gBT-I cells on day 4. After pre-gating on live singlets,
   gBT-I cells are distinguished as CD45.1^+, vα2 T cell receptor-positive
   (TCR^+), and CD8^+ cells. The representative dot plot (left) of CD45.1
   and vα2 TCR staining, indicates the enrichment of gBT-I cells (red
   quadrant). The representative histogram (right) shows the expression of
   CD8 on gBT-I cells. The dot plot and histogram are representative of
   over 3 independent experiments.

Global expression profiles were distinct between TGF-β-treated and
TGF-β-untreated groups

   Exploratory analysis was performed on 10,941 abundant genes (FPKM >
   0.3) across all samples. Principal components analysis (PCA) was
   carried out to characterise overall variation in gene expression
   profiles amongst TGF-β-treated and TGF-β-untreated samples. PCA showed
   that the first 3 principal components (PCs) explained more than 80% of
   total gene expression variance. PC1 (39.9%) was mildly related to IL-2
   treatment ([97]Fig 2A). The TGF-β-treated samples separated from the
   TGF-β-untreated groups primarily along the PC2 axis, which explained
   24.6% of the variation in the data ([98]Fig 2A). Hierarchical
   clustering showed two clear groups based on TGF-β treatment ([99]Fig
   2B).

   hierarchical cluster analysis of all the samples based on their

   Dendrogram branches are coloured by TGF-β treatment: TGF-β-treated
   groups (blue) and TGF-β-untreated groups (orange). The dots represent
   biological samples coloured according to TGF-β treatment they received.
   Biological replicates (Rep.1-3) for each treatment have the same
   colour.

Identification of genes differentially expressed between TGF-β -treated and
TGF-β-untreated groups

   Differentially expressed genes between TGF-β-treated and
   TGF-β-untreated groups were identified using Cuffdiff2 [[102]25] on
   three pairwise comparison groups: (1) TGF-β vs. Untreated; (2)
   IL-2/TGF-β vs. Untreated; and (3) IL-2/TGF-β vs. IL-2. The numbers of
   significantly DE genes obtained in each comparison are summarised in
   [103]Table 1. The list of DE genes was further narrowed down based on
   fold change: greater than 2 –(|log2FC| > 1) and 4 –fold (|log2F| > 2)
   ([104]Table 1 and Table C in [105]S1 Table). Across all fold change
   cut-offs, in all the three comparisons, it was noted that TGF-β
   treatment resulted in mostly up-regulated genes. A similar trend was
   also seen with the top 30 most DE genes (based on |log2FC| > 2) common
   in all three comparisons ([106]S2 Fig). Among this list, Itgae (CD103)
   was one of the top induced genes, providing transcriptional support to
   the role of TGF-β in up-regulating CD103 expression in TRM cells. The
   transcriptional upregulation of Itgae directly translated into higher
   levels of CD103 in TGF-β treated cells ([107]S3 Fig). Hence, in this
   study, in vitro stimulation of CD8^+ effector T cells with TGF-β
   produced a TRM-like phenotype.

Functional analysis of genes differentially expressed in TGF-β-treated groups

   To further characterise the genes differentially regulated in response
   to TGF-β stimulation, GO enrichment terms associated with biological
   processes were assigned to 416 common DE genes in the three comparison
   groups. GO enrichment was performed using GOrilla [[109]28] on three
   sets of DE genes: up-regulated genes, down-regulated genes, and both
   sets combined. The significant GO terms (FDR < 0.05) were then further
   summarised into representative terms using REVIGO [[110]29]. The top 10
   over-represented GO terms among the DE genes in the TGF-β-treated
   groups, ranked by enriched P-values, are shown in [111]Fig 3. All the
   254 up-regulated genes were associated with at least one GO term. The
   most enriched biological processes among the up-regulated genes were
   related to the regulation of signalling, signal transduction, cell
   communication and cell movement ([112]Fig 3B). 160 of 162
   down-regulated genes had GO term annotations. These genes were largely
   involved in regulation of cell adhesion and response to stimulus
   ([113]Fig 3C).

   (y-axes) were ranked according to their enrichment P-values (x-axes).
   The numbers on top of the bar plots in parentheses denote the total
   number of all DE, up-, and down-regulated genes with GO term
   annotations. The numbers at the end of each bar represent the actual
   number of all DE genes; up- or down-regulated genes that were
   classified to a particular biological process. All GO terms listed were
   significant at FDR < 0.05. All of the 254 common up-regulated genes in
   the TGF-β-treated groups were associated with GO terms. 160 out of 162
   common down-regulated genes in the TGF-β-treated groups were annotated
   with GO terms.

Transcriptional profiles of TGF-β-treated T cells were enriched for
TRM-related gene signature

   Given that TGF-β has been shown to induce CD103 expression in the skin,
   lung, and gut [[116]8,[117]11,[118]12,[119]17,[120]18], we hypothesized
   that the residency-related TRM cell genes shared across these tissues
   might reflect further TGF-β imprinting. We therefore sought to
   determine whether TGF-β stimulated CD8^+ T cells established under in
   vitro conditions share a gene signature with murine TRM cells isolated
   from these three tissues. To do so, the list of DE genes in each of the
   TGF-β-treated groups was compared against genes previously established
   as the core TRM-related signature [[121]12]. The core TRM-related
   signature consisted of 35 genes that were significantly up- or down-
   regulated in murine TRM cells from skin, gut, and lung in comparison to
   their circulating spleen counterparts. We found 46–60% of these genes
   were consistently expressed in a similar manner in our TGF-β-treated
   groups ([122]Fig 4). The overlap between the TRM core signature and the
   full set of differentially expressed genes in all the three treatment
   comparisons was statistically significant (P < 0.001) in a
   bootstrapping permutation test (Methods). The majority of the
   overlapping TRM core signature genes were up-regulated in the
   TGF-β-treated groups, consistent with the hypothesis that TGF-β induces
   genes that promote the maintenance of TRM cells in tissues. The TRM
   core genes that were consistently up-regulated in all the TGF-β-treated
   groups included Cdh244, Chd1, Chn2, Hpgds, Inpp4b, Itga1, Itgae, Qpct,
   Rgs1, Rgs2 and Skil. Fam65b was the only TRM-related gene that was
   consistently down-regulated across all the TGF-β-treated groups.

   TGF-β-treated groups. Consistently up-regulated genes are depicted in
   red, and down-regulated genes are shown in blue. Grey represents genes
   that were either not significantly DE in TGF-β-treated groups vs.
   TGF-β-untreated groups or whose direction of DE was not concordant
   between TRM cells and TGF-β-treated groups. The numbers in the pie
   chart denote the percentage overlap between the genes in the
   TRM-related signature and genes DE (FDR < 0.05) in the TGF-β-treated
   groups. The P-values next to the pie charts denote the enrichment
   P-values calculated via bootstrapping (Methods).

   Next, we examined if TGF-β influenced the transcriptional signature of
   TRM cells in a tissue-specific manner. To do so, we performed GSEA to
   test whether the differentially expressed genes in the TGF-β-treated
   groups were enriched for tissue-specific TRM cell-associated genes from
   both epithelial (skin, gut, and lungs) and non-epithelial tissues
   (brain and liver). The tissue-specific TRM cell-associated gene sets
   comprised genes previously identified as either up- or down-regulated
   in murine TRM cells from skin, gut, lung, brain, and liver in
   comparison to their circulating counterparts [[125]12,[126]31,[127]32].
   The list of all 10 up- and down-regulated gene sets is provided in
   Table A in [128]S1 Table (see [129]Methods for details). GSEA confirmed
   that all five up-regulated and five down-regulated gene sets were
   significantly (P-value < 0.05) enriched in the DE genes in our
   TGF-β-treated groups ([130]Fig 5 and Table D in [131]S1 Table).
   Surprisingly, despite the absence of CD103 expression on liver TRM
   cells, we found that liver TRM gene sets were also significantly
   enriched. Genes that were up-regulated in TRM cells had higher
   expression in the TGF-β-treated groups ([132]Fig 5A), whereas
   down-regulated genes had higher expression in the TGF-β-untreated
   groups ([133]Fig 5B). By contrast, TEM- and TCM-related gene sets
   (negative control gene sets) showed no enrichment for the
   TGF-β-responsive transcriptional profile ([134]S4 Fig and Table D in
   [135]S1 Table). Taken together, these results support the role of TGF-β
   signalling in shaping the transcriptional signature in TRM cells across
   multiple diverse tissues. This further suggests that TGF-β has a broad
   impact on the transcriptional machinery underlying tissue residency in
   different TRM cell populations.

Discussion

   TRM cells play an important role in providing first-line defence at
   barrier sites [[138]2,[139]3,[140]5–[141]9]. However, the
   tissue-specific signals required for their differentiation and
   long-term persistence at these sites are not well established. An
   improved understanding of how local tissue factors contribute to the
   generation and maintenance of TRM cells will be important for the
   development of vaccines and immunotherapies designed to elicit
   tissue-directed immunity. TGF-β is by far the best characterised
   tissue-derived signal known to be required for the differentiation of
   CD103^+ TRM cells in the skin, gut, and lungs by inducing CD103
   expression [[142]8,[143]11,[144]12,[145]17,[146]18]. Here we show that
   TGF-β-stimulated CD8^+ T cells established under in vitro conditions
   acquired a gene expression signature enriched for TRM-related genes
   from multiple tissues.

   The comparable 40–60% expression pattern similarity expands our view of
   TGF-β as a factor required for the initial generation of TRM cells to a
   more broadly acting cytokine influencing the majority of TRM-associated
   genes, which are most likely linked to their survival and persistence.
   Our results are consistent with previous studies showing that
   continuous signalling by TGF-β is required for TRM cells to be locally
   maintained long-term [[147]33,[148]34]. Our analysis further revealed
   that the TGF-β induced signature was significantly enriched for
   TRM-related genes identified in TRM cells from both epithelial (skin,
   gut, and lung) and non-epithelial (brain and liver) tissues. This
   suggests that TGF-β signalling might play an important role in shaping
   the common transcriptional program that underpins tissue residency of
   TRM cell populations across organs.

   Several TRM-associated genes that play an essential role in tissue
   residency were common in the TGF-β induced gene signature. Itgae, which
   encodes for CD103, was one of the most significantly up-regulated genes
   in the TGF-β-treated group, consistent with previous findings that
   TGF-β induces CD103 expression on TRM cells [[149]11,[150]18,[151]35].
   CD103 binds to its ligand E-cadherin, which is expressed on the
   epithelial surfaces of the skin and gut; possibly meditating the
   retention of TRM cells by tethering them within these tissues
   [[152]36,[153]37]. It has been shown that CD103-deficient mice had
   lower T cell numbers in skin, intestinal, and vaginal epithelium
   [[154]12,[155]36,[156]38] in the memory phase, further suggesting that
   TGF-β induced expression of CD103 is important for tissue retention of
   TRM cells. Moreover, the long-term retention of CD103 deficient T cells
   was not as severely impaired compared to cells lacking the TGF-β
   receptor [[157]17]. Hence, the effect of TGF-β signalling on TRM cells
   must be broader than just for the initial induction of CD103 and
   subsequent adherence of TRM cells. Additionally, Cdh1 and Itga1, which
   also encode for adhesion molecules, were up-regulated in the
   TGF-β-treated group. Cdh1 and Itga1 genes encode for the E-cadherin and
   alpha 1 subunit of integrin receptors, respectively, and have been
   previously reported to be up-regulated in TRM cells
   [[158]12,[159]31,[160]39]. In Langerhans cells, TGF-β dependent
   induction of E-cadherin is crucial for their residency and maintenance
   in the skin [[161]40], implicating a similar requisite in TRM cells.
   Indeed, genetic deficiency in E-cadherin expression has been shown to
   result in a defect of CD103^+ TRM generation in salivary glands
   [[162]14]. Increased expression of the chemokine Xcl1 was also noted in
   the TGF-β-treated group. Similarly, several studies have reported high
   expression levels of Xcl1 in TRM cells [[163]12,[164]31,[165]39]. We
   also observed several other genes previously found to be highly
   expressed in TRM cells to be consistently up-regulated in the
   TGF-β-treated group. This included genes encoding for costimulatory
   receptors involved in immunomodulation (Ctla4, and Icos), enzymes
   (Inapp4b and Qpct), and signalling regulators that mediate tissue
   retention (Rgs1 and Rgs2) [[166]12,[167]31,[168]39]. Hence, the
   significant overlap seen between genes involved in TRM cell retention
   and those in the TGF-β induced signature suggests that TGF-β dependent
   induction of these genes may be broadly important for the establishment
   of residency by TRM cells at tissue sites.

   A potential limitation of this study is that it used in vitro
   stimulated CD8^+ T cells as a surrogate for the differentiation of TRM
   cells. The development and tissue-specific activation of TRM cells
   likely require precise temporal and spatial regulation of gene
   expression, which may be achieved by a combination of locally expressed
   cytokines and by epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications
   and DNA methylation. Hence, it is likely that epigenetic changes and/or
   tissue-specific local cues other than TGF-β will have an additional
   impact on the transcriptional signature of TRM cells at tissue sites in
   vivo. However, the in vitro activated cells treated with TGF-β appear
   very similar to TRM cells, since more than half of the genes were
   regulated in a way that is reminiscent of the regulation of genes
   observed in TRM versus circulating cells in previous studies. Thus, our
   analyses corroborate the central role TGF-β plays in imprinting a
   transcriptional profile in TRM cells. Nevertheless, further in vivo
   studies are required to establish how constant “education” by TGF-β
   directs TRM cells to acquire long-term maintenance capacity in various
   epithelial and non-epithelial tissue sites.
