To address your questions regarding the pathway enrichment analysis from the article, here's a structured response:

1. **Tool Used for Pathway Enrichment Analysis:**
   - The tool used was GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis).

2. **Version Number of the Tool:**
   - Not described in the provided text.

3. **Gene Set Library Queried:**
   - The libraries queried included KEGG, GO (Gene Ontology), Reactome, and Hallmark gene sets.

4. **Background Gene List Defined:**
   - A background gene list was defined, consisting of genes expressed at an FPKM ≥ 1 in any of the samples being compared.

5. **Statistical Test Used for Enrichment Analysis:**
   - The enrichment analysis used a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.

6. **False Discovery Rate Correction:**
   - Yes, false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis.

This information can be collated into a table as follows:

| Question | Answer                      |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| 1. Tool Used                     | GSEA                         |
| 2. Version Number                | Not described                |
| 3. Gene Set Library              | KEGG, GO, Reactome, Hallmark |
| 4. Background Gene List          | Genes with FPKM ≥ 1         |
| 5. Statistical Test              | Weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov  |
| 6. False Discovery Rate Correction | Yes                         |
