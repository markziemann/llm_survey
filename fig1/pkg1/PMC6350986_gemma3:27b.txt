| 1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2. Was a tool version number provided?          | Not described                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 3. What gene set library was queried?         | Not explicitly stated which specific library within GSEA was used, but they mention categories like ‘apoptosis’, ‘chemosensory response’ etc. which suggests custom/defined categories *in addition* to standard libraries, though which standard library they may have also used is not stated. |
| 4. Was a background gene list defined?       | Yes, the background gene list was defined as all coding genes (n = 14,626) used for comparison.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis? | Binomial probability distributions and hypergeometric tests were used.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 6. Was false discovery rate correction used?  | Yes, Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction was used with an alpha value of 0.01.                                                                                                                                                                  |
