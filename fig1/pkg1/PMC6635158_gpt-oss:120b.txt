We need to extract from the article the details about pathway enrichment analysis. In Methods, subsection 2.4 "Gene ontology functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis". It says: "The gene ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integration Discovery (DAVID 6.8)." So tool: DAVID (version 6.8). Gene set libraries: GO and KEGG. Background gene list? Not described. Statistical test: DAVID uses modified Fisher's Exact (EASE) test; but article does not specify. Not described. Multiple testing correction? Not mentioned. Only p-value <.05 and gene count ≥2 cutoff. No FDR. So answer accordingly.

Provide table with columns: Question, Answer.

List each question.

Let's produce.
