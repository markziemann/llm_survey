Thinking...
We need to extract info about pathway enrichment analysis.

Let's scan the Methods section. In the provided text under "Delineating methods", there is a subsection "Biofunction enrichment analysis and verification" maybe. Wait in Methods they have a section:

"Biofunction enrichment analysis and verification" is in Results. But in Methods there is a section "Delineating details for pathway enrichment analysis".

Let's scroll to Methods in article. The Methods part includes sections: "Delineating ...", "Functional analysis of genes", etc.

Scrolling the provided article text: Under Methods we have:

"Functional analysis of genes differentially regulated between CVS and SVS." Actually earlier:

"Functional analysis of genes differentially regulated between CVS and SVS." That's in Results.

But the Methods section includes a paragraph:

"Further investigations were presented to determine the apoptosis..."

Wait, earlier there is a paragraph:

"GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed to better understand the biological function of the co-differentially expressed DEmRNAs."

But need explicit description.

Let's search in the Methods part:

The Methods sections are:

- "Delineating ...", maybe not.

We have these headings in Methods:

- "Delineating ..."? Actually not. The article's methods include sections:

- "Delineating ..."? Hmm.

Let's read the Methods sections from the provided article:

The article includes:

"Functional analysis of genes differentially regulated between CVS and SVS." That's in Figure 3.

But the actual Methods text describing enrichment analysis appears in a paragraph titled "Biofunction enrichment analysis and verification". In Methods, under "Biofunction enrichment analysis and verification", there is a paragraph:

"For further analysis, the DEmRNAs were uploaded to the online tool DAVID, the DEmRNAs were significantly enriched in ..."

Wait, we need to locate the exact sentence: In the Methods section, there is a sub-section:

"Further investigations were presented to determine the apoptosis...". That's not.

Let's locate the paragraph about pathway analysis.

Scrolling: In the Methods there is a heading "Susceptible pathways and clusters". Actually "Susceptible pathways and clusters" appears in Results.

In the Methods there is a paragraph:

"The KEGG pathway map from DAVID indicated that the co-differentially expressed DEmRNAs were significantly enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and the pathways in cancer, the AMPK, FOXO, and chemokine signaling pathways (Fig. 4a)."

But the Methods for enrichment are earlier: In the Methods, after describing GO analysis, they mention "For molecular function (MF)..." but that's part of results.

Let's locate the specific description of enrichment analysis in Methods:

Search for "DAVID" in the article.

In Methods, under "Biofunction enrichment analysis and verification", maybe they mention "we used the online tool DAVID". Let's locate.

Scrolling the article: In the Methods part:

"Based on the DEmRNAs uploaded to the online tool DAVID, the DEmRNAs were significantly enriched in ..."

But we need the exact wording.

Scrolling:

In the article text:

"Further investigations were presented to determine the apoptosis..." Not.

Search for "DAVID".

Yes, there is a paragraph in Results: "Further investigations were presented ..."

Wait earlier there is: "For molecular function (MF), the DEmRNAs were involved in ... (Fig. 3a). In addition, the GO cell component (CC) analysis also showed ... (Fig. 3a)." That's in Results, but not methods.

But the Methods likely contain the description: Under "Biofunction enrichment analysis and verification" there may be mention of "DAVID". Let's find.

In the article's "Methods" there is a paragraph:

"The GO cell component (CC) analysis also showed that the DEmRNAs were significantly enriched..."

But we need to find the sentence that says "The DEmRNAs were uploaded to the online tool DAVID for GO and KEGG enrichment analysis." Something like that.

Search for "KEGG" in Methods: I saw in Methods:

"The KEGG pathway map from DAVID indicated that the co-differentially expressed DEmRNAs were significantly enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway..."

But that's Results.

But the Methods likely include a subheading "Susceptible pathways and clusters". There they may describe.

Let's examine the Methods section again fully. The article's Methods sections:

"Functional analysis of genes differentially regulated between CVS and SVS." Actually that's a heading in Results.

Let's re-read the Methods part from the article (starting after the initial part). The article's text after "Methods" is:

"Functional analysis of genes differentially regulated between CVS and SVS." Wait no.

Let's go back to the beginning of Methods.

From the article content:

The Methods sections appear after the "Materials and methods" typical heading. The article's excerpt includes:

- "Delineating" ... Not.

Wait scanning: In the article we have:

"Based on the PPI network derived from the STRING database, Cytoscape software was employed for visualizing the network of the co-differentially expressed DEmRNAs (Fig. 5a). The MCODE plugin in Cytoscape further presented the most significant cluster (Fig. 5B), including PTEN, FOXO1, FOXO3, VEGFA, and SIRT1."

But that's for PPI.

For enrichment: earlier there is a paragraph:

"The GO term analysis showed that these DEmRNAs were mainly involved in apoptosis, angiogenesis, cellular response to hypoxia, nuclear chromatin, cell surface, extracellular space, apical plasma membrane, and basolateral plasma membrane. In addition, the KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the co-differentially expressed DEmRNAs were significantly enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and the pathways in cancer, the AMPK, FOXO, and chemokine signaling pathways."

Now we need explicit methods for enrichment.

Let's locate the "Methods" heading text again:

Scrolling the article:

"Biofunction enrichment analysis and verification" maybe is a subheading in Results, but methods for enrichment may be described under "Biofunction enrichment analysis and verification".

But there is also a paragraph in Methods titled "Biofunction enrichment analysis and verification". Let's search:

The provided article text includes:

"Further investigations were presented to determine the apoptosis, cellular response to hypoxia, and extracellular space changes in CVS tumor tissues by TUNEL. immunoblotting, and TEM. Compared with the SVS tissues, the CVS tissues showed less cellularity and increased apoptotic cells (TUNEL positive) (Fig. 3b and c), suggesting that apoptosis might be enhanced in CVS."

But not methods.

However there is a paragraph in the Methods section earlier that describes GO and KEGG enrichment.

Let's search for "DAVID" in the Methods text: It appears in the paragraph "The DEmRNAs were uploaded to the online tool DAVID". Actually that might be in Results.

But the question asks "Focus on the Methods section, but you may also refer to Results, Figures, or Supplementary Materials if necessary. Extract only what is explicitly reported." So we need to answer based on explicit statements.

Let's list what we have:

- Tool used for pathway enrichment analysis: The article explicitly mentions "DAVID" (the online tool). Also they mention "KEGG pathway map from DAVID" and "GO term analysis". They also mention "The KEGG pathway map from DAVID indicated..." So the enrichment tool is DAVID.

- They also used "STRING database" for PPI network, but not for enrichment.

- They also used "MCODE plugin in Cytoscape" for clusters, but that's not enrichment.

- For GO analysis they used "DAVID" as well, which uses GO terms.

- For KEGG pathway analysis they used "DAVID".

Thus answer: tool = DAVID.

- Version number: Not described.

- Gene set libraries used: GO (Biological Process, Molecular Function, Cellular Component) and KEGG.

- Background gene list: Not described. They didn't state a specific background list.

- Statistical test(s) used in enrichment analysis: Not described. They didn't mention hypergeometric test, etc.

- Multiple testing correction: Not described. They only mention p-value threshold (p < 0.05) maybe. Let's verify: In Methods they say "Statistically significant ... with p < 0.05" but not for enrichment. Let's find: In GO analysis they might mention "p < 0.05" but not FDR. In Methods they said "Not described". So answer No.

Thus create table.

Columns:

Tool(s) | Version | Gene set libraries | Background list used? | Statistical test(s) | Multiple testing correction applied?

Let's fill:

- Tool: DAVID

- Version: Not described

- Gene set libraries: GO (Biological Process, Cellular Component, Molecular Function) and KEGG

- Background list: Not described

- Statistical test(s): Not described

- Multiple testing correction: No (since not described)

Now produce table.

...done thinking.
