Thinking...
We need to extract details about pathway enrichment analysis from the article. Let's locate relevant sections.

In the article text (the snippet above) we see in "Positive Selection Analysis" they mention:

"GO category enrichment among positively selected genes was performed with the STRING database online software ([199]101)."

Also earlier in Results: "GO category enrichment among positively selected genes was performed with the STRING database online software ([199]101)."

Thus tool: STRING database online software (maybe STRING). Not a typical enrichment tool but they used it.

Also maybe "GO category enrichment" suggests they used GO categories.

The Methods section under "Positive Selection Analysis" includes:

"GO category enrichment among positively selected genes was performed with the STRING database online software ([199]101)."

Thus tool: STRING (online). No version given? Possibly "STRING 11.0" appears under "Software Versions": "STRING 11.0". Indeed, software versions list includes "STRING 11.0". That may be version for enrichment analysis.

Gene set libraries used: GO categories (Gene Ontology). Maybe also they used GO for enrichment.

They might have used "STRING database" which includes GO terms; but the question: Which gene set libraries were used? The article explicitly mentions GO category enrichment. So library: GO (Gene Ontology). Possibly also "STRING database" but that is a tool, not library. The library is GO categories.

Background gene list: Not described; they didn't state custom background. So "Not described".

Statistical test(s) used in enrichment analysis: Not described. The article doesn't mention which statistical test used by STRING. It just says performed with STRING. So answer "Not described".

Multiple testing correction: Not described. No mention.

Now format the table with columns: Question, Answer(s) (list). Provide six questions. Let's craft.

We need to list all tools used for pathway enrichment analysis. That's only STRING.

Version: STRING 11.0 (if considered). The article includes "Software Versions" list: "STRING 11.0". So version: 11.0.

Gene set libraries: GO (Gene Ontology). Maybe also KEGG etc? Not mentioned. So only GO.

Custom background: Not described.

Statistical test(s): Not described.

Multiple testing correction: Not described.

Now produce table. Let's make columns: Question, Answer.

...done thinking.
