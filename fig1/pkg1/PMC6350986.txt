Abstract

   Association mapping of factors that condition pyrethroid resistance in
   Aedes aegypti has consistently identified genes in multiple functional
   groups. Toward better understanding of the mechanisms involved, we
   examined high throughput sequencing data (HTS) from two Aedes aegypti
   aegypti collections from Merida, Yucatan, Mexico treated with either
   permethrin or deltamethrin. Exome capture enrichment for coding regions
   and the AaegL5 annotation were used to identify genes statistically
   associated with resistance. The frequencies of single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) were compared between resistant and susceptible
   mosquito pools using a contingency χ^2 analysis. The -log[10](χ^2 p
   value) was calculated at each SNP site, with a weighted average
   determined from all sites in each gene. Genes with -log[10](χ^2 p
   value) ≥ 4.0 and present among all 3 treatment groups were subjected to
   gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). We found that several functional
   groups were enriched compared to all coding genes. These categories
   were transport, signal transduction and metabolism, in order from
   highest to lowest statistical significance. Strikingly, 21 genes with
   demonstrated association to synaptic function were identified. In the
   high association group (n = 1,053 genes), several genes were identified
   that also genetically or physically interact with the voltage-gated
   sodium channel (VGSC). These genes were eg., CHARLATAN (CHL), a
   transcriptional regulator, several ankyrin-domain proteins, PUMILIO
   (PUM), a translational repressor, and NEDD4 (E3 ubiquitin-protein
   ligase). There were 13 genes that ranked among the top 10%: these
   included VGSC; CINGULIN, a predicted neuronal gap junction protein, and
   the aedine ortholog of NERVY (NVY), a transcriptional regulator.
   Silencing of CHL and NVY followed by standard permethrin bottle
   bioassays validated their association with permethrin resistance.
   Importantly, VGSC levels were also reduced about 50% in chl- or
   nvy-dsRNA treated mosquitoes. These results are consistent with the
   contribution of a variety of neuronal pathways to pyrethroid resistance
   in Ae. aegypti.

Introduction

   The major arbovirus vector Aedes aegypti continues to pose significant
   threats to human health in tropical and subtropical urban areas
   [[35]1,[36]2]. In southern Mexico, where dengue is hyperendemic
   [[37]3], insecticides used for Ae. aegypti control include
   organophosphates for larval control and pyrethroids for adults [[38]4].
   The voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc, aaeN[AV], LOC5567355) is one
   target of pyrethroid toxicity [[39]5]. Increased resistance in Ae.
   aegypti to pyrethroid insecticides has been documented in many
   locations [[40]6–[41]9], and is associated with the presence of
   specific VGSC alleles. In addition, multiple lines of evidence indicate
   that metabolic resistance mechanisms may be equally important as
   target-site resistance [[42]10–[43]13]. Metabolic resistance to
   pyrethroids is generally described as a number of Vgsc-independent
   mechanisms derived from gene duplication, transcript overexpression,
   sequestration or increased reduction/oxidation (redox) activity.
   Cytochromes P450 (CYP), episilon class glutathione S-transferases
   (eGST) and esterases (EST) are major contributors to metabolic
   resistance, which are stimulated in response to oxidative stress
   [[44]14–[45]16].

   To further increase our understanding of pyrethroid resistance
   mechanisms, the aim of the present study was to use association mapping
   to characterize allele frequency differences in genes for two Ae.
   aegypti aegypti field locations. One was located in the community of
   Viva Caucel in the city of Merida in the Mexican state of Yucatán and
   the other in Vergel in the same city. These locations were chosen
   because the association between VGSC genotype and permethrin knockdown
   resistance (kdr) phenotype were known for each site [[46]9].
   Specifically, Vgsc target site resistance loci V1016I and F1534C (house
   fly protein annotation), were present in each population. According to
   Vera-Maloof et al. 2015, in the Viva Caucel collection, the V1016I and
   F1534C mutations were present in 75% and 93% of individuals assayed,
   respectively. Similarly, in the Vergel collection, V1016I and F1534C
   were present in 80% and 98% of individuals assayed, respectively. Thus,
   in both locations, the F1534C allele was close to fixation. These
   characteristics indicated that the natural populations from which the
   collections were derived had already been selected for permethrin
   resistance.

   Our hypothesis was that pyrethroid resistance-associated genes could be
   those with 1) chromosomal physical proximity to VGSC, resulting from a
   selective sweep, 2) selection due to direct activity in resistance or
   3) genetic drift. For the present study, exome capture genomic DNA
   (gDNA) high throughput sequencing (HTS) data from both locations with
   two pyrethroid insecticides were analyzed to identify SNPs that
   differed significantly in frequency between susceptible and resistant
   pools in a given collection. We then highlighted those genes with
   significant genetic association to pyrethroid resistance. Genetic
   association refers to the concurrent presence of genotypic
   polymorphisms, as indicated by–log[10](p value) scores from χ^2
   contingency table calculations, and the pyrethroid resistance
   phenotype. We used orthology information to assign functional
   attributes for all coding genes and used that information to identify
   those with statistical association to pyrethroid resistance. In
   addition, the gene set common to all treatment groups was subjected to
   GSEA [[47]17]. Identification of genes common to both permethrin- and
   deltamethrin-resistant mosquitoes would give insight into overall
   pyrethroid resistance mechanisms. The identification of common
   mechanisms would also build support for increasing variability of
   rotating pyrethroid spraying regimens to reduce selection of resistant
   loci [[48]18].

Results and discussion

Treatment and high throughput sequencing

   A total of 3 pyrethroid treatment groups were evaluated for this work.
   Two groups, from the Viva Caucel location, were treated with either
   permethrin or deltamethrin. The third group, from the Vergel location,
   was treated with permethrin. Our rationale for evaluating combined data
   for type 1 and type 2 pyrethroids was 1) to identify genomic loci that
   are common among both treatment types and 2) reduce the identification
   of population-specific loci. Previously published bottle assay results
   are summarized in [49]Table 1 [[50]8,[51]9]. Dual independent replicate
   pools of adult females (n = 25 per pool) from each population were
   prepared for a total of 12 library sets, comprising four from each
   location/treatment group (see [52]Fig 1 legend). Then they were
   exome-capture enriched for genic regions [[53]19,[54]20]. From 27.25–86
   million trimmed paired end reads were obtained for each replicate
   library ([55]Table 2, [56]S1 Table), and 94 to 98% of all trimmed reads
   aligned to the AaegL5 chromosome length reference sequence [[57]21],
   which allowed for mapping of genes to their approximate physical
   location and eliminated the problems with unmapped genes that we
   experienced in previous studies [[58]19].

   At each SNP, χ^2 contingency table calculations determined statistical
   association of a given SNP to pyrethroid resistance. Resistance
   associated gene-wise scores were calculated from the weighted
   average–log[10](p value) of the top 5% of SNP scores per gene (see
   [65]Methods). Prior to further analysis, a multiple-testing adjustment
   (false discovery rate, FDR, alpha = 0.01) [[66]22] and -log[10](χ^2 p
   value) ≥ 4.0 cut-offs were applied. Collection-specific details are
   shown in [67]S2 Table. Gene-wise association scores above the cut-off
   were mapped relative to each gene’s physical position for each
   collection ([68]Fig 1).

Groups with high association to pyrethroid resistance

   To identify high association genes and functional categories associated
   with pyrethroid resistance among all three treatment groups, the
   intersection of genes above the thresholds were determined ([69]Fig 2A,
   n = 1,054). One of these was a non-coding RNA and therefore was
   excluded from further analysis, leaving 1053 coding genes ([70]S2
   Table). This high association set was annotated by predicted function
   based on orthology to model organisms [[71]23]. Overall functional
   groups for these genes are displayed in [72]Fig 2B. Within the common
   gene set, the relative physical position of each gene and the
   corresponding genetic association values by collection are shown in
   [73]Fig 3. Strikingly, though the common gene subset spanned all three
   chromosomes ([74]S2 Table), most genes (1,023 of 1,053) were on
   chromosomes 2 and 3.

VGSC and associated genes

   As expected, our tests revealed high statistical association of VGSC,
   the target of permethrin, in all three treatment groups ([78]S2 Table).
   VGSC is located on the q arm of chromosome 3 [[79]21,[80]24] ([81]Fig
   3). Intriguingly, some genes in the high association group interact
   with VGSC in other organisms. For example, CHL (LOC5578279), a
   neuronal-specific zinc-Cys2His2 type transcriptional regulator
   [[82]25], genetically interacts with the drosophilid ortholog of VGSC
   (PARA) [[83]26]. Synaptic control of motoneuron function has been
   characterized in dipteran models of epilepsy, wherein increased
   frequency and regularity of calcium signaling waves, synaptic
   excitation, are indicative of pathology [[84]26–[85]29]. For example,
   in a drosophilid epilepsy model, reduced expression of CHL further
   increased sensitivity of the PARA bang-sensitive (PARA ^bss) allele,
   which has a high basal sensitivity to paralysis. PARA ^bss was also
   sensitive to alterations in calcium levels [[86]29], which is
   consistent with a functional interaction between Vgsc and calcium
   channels. Similarly, deltamethrin has been shown to reduce calcium
   channel efflux in mammalian and mosquito cell culture [[87]30–[88]32].
   Consistent with this evidence, a calcium channel alpha subunit (caα1,
   LOC5564339) was also within the high association group.

   The ankyrin protein domain is present in a large variety of structural
   proteins that link transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton
   [[89]33,[90]34]; they serve a variety of functions, including
   cytoskeletal anchoring and mechano-transduction of sensory responses
   [[91]35,[92]36]. A subset of these proteins physically interacts with
   Vgsc in mammals [[93]28]. Five ankyrin domain-containing proteins were
   also identified in our high association gene set ([94]S2 Table).
   Finally, NEDD4, also a high association gene, has predicted physical
   interactions with N[AV] (Vgsc) in mammals ([95]S2 Table) [[96]37].
   Additional support for N[AV]-Nedd4 interactions was also observed in
   its regulation of cardiac N[AV] [[97]38]. NEDD4 codes for E3
   ubiquitin-protein ligase, which regulates degradation of plasma
   membrane proteins with PY motifs [[98]39]. Aedine Vgsc has a partial PY
   motif (PPS, amino acids 1170–1172) rather than the canonical PY of
   mammalian N[AV] proteins (PPSYDSV) [[99]40]. Until now, no support for
   VGSC-NEDD4 interactions has been reported for dipterans.

   The importance of each of the associations summarized above was further
   substantiated by GSEA of each corresponding functional category. We
   tested each functional group for relative enrichment within the high
   association set compared to all coding genes. This was done using a
   hypergeometric test, which models a binomial distribution and tests the
   probability of a gene being represented more often than expected by
   chance [[100]41]. Specific results are described below in the context
   of each functional group.

Selected gene silencing and phenotype validation

   To further explore the role of selected genes in pyrethroid resistance,
   we evaluated 2 putative transcription regulators in the high
   association data set. We hypothesized that when silenced, relevant
   components would result in increased pyrethroid susceptibility. One
   gene, NVY (LOC5563881), codes for a predicted central and peripheral
   nervous system-specific transcriptional regulator [[101]42] with dual
   functions in axon guidance [[102]43] and transcriptional repression
   [[103]44]. The other gene, CHL, described above, is genetically
   associated with VGSC in drosophilids. We used RNA interference-induced
   gene silencing via dsRNA-injection to temporarily silence each gene in
   Vergel colony mosquitoes (F[24]). Silencing was confirmed relative to
   levels in non-specific dsRNA (β-Gal-dsRNA) treated controls ([104]Fig
   4A), and mosquitoes were subjected to a 1.5 μg permethrin
   discriminating dose in standard CDC bottle assays [[105]45]. Both
   nvy-dsRNA and chl-dsRNA injected groups were significantly more
   susceptible to permethrin knockdown than (β-GAL- dsRNA)-injected
   controls (analysis of variance (ANOVA), p<0.0001) ([106]Fig 4B). In
   contrast, PBS-injected controls showed sensitivity and viability levels
   that paralleled that of the β-GAL-injected group, indicating that
   exogenous dsRNA treatment alone had no effect ([107]S1 Fig). The
   proportion of mosquitoes with lethal phenotypes at 24 hours
   post-treatment was also significantly greater in nvy-dsRNA and
   chl-dsRNA groups than that of β-GAL-dsRNA-injected mosquitoes (Fisher's
   exact test, p = 0.001 and p<0.0001, respectively) ([108]Fig 4B).

   A) Gene silencing validation. Mosquitoes were injected with either
   chl-dsRNA or nvy-dsRNA and processed in pools (n = 5) to isolate RNA at
   3 days-post-treatment (dpt). Target transcripts were silenced an
   average of 93% and 78% in chl-dsRNA and nvy-dsRNA mosquitoes,
   respectively, relative to βGal-dsRNA-injected controls. B) Mosquitoes
   were injected with βGal-dsRNA (n = 113), chl-dsRNA (n = 172) or
   nvy-dsRNA (n = 129). At 3 dpt, each replicate was subjected to ~1.5 ug
   permethrin in a CDC bottle assay; knockdown was recorded at 10 minute
   intervals. There was a significant difference between chl and nvy
   compared to β-Gal controls ***, (ANOVA, CHL, p<0.0001; NVY, p<0.0001).
   At 24 hours, mortality was also significantly elevated (Fisher’s Exact
   Test, CHL, p<0.0001, NVY, p = 0.001). Left Y axis indicates percent
   knockdown from 10–60 minutes. Right Y-axis indicates percent mortality
   at 24 hours. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean (SEM).
   Bottle assay data represent a compilation of 4 to 5 biological
   replicates. C) Pools of 5 chl-dsRNA and nvy-dsRNA treated mosquitoes
   were subjected qRT-PCR of VGSC relative to βGal-dsRNA injected
   controls. Results shown are the average of 3 biological and 3 technical
   replicates.

   Analysis of VGSC transcript levels showed a ~50% reduction following
   nvy-dsRNA or chl-dsRNA treatment compared to β-GAL-dsRNA-injected
   controls, indicating that each transcriptional regulator plays a role
   in modulating VGSC transcript levels ([111]Fig 4C). The association
   mapping data was interrogated to identify CHL and NVY non-synonymous
   mutations in each of the collections. No non-synonymous mutations (LOD
   >4.0) were identified in either CHL or NVY in the VCD collection,
   suggestive of cis-regulatory effects. A single common mutation at A2T
   occurred in VCP and VeP, with a few other isolated amino acid
   substitutions in CHL ([112]Fig 4D).

Detoxification and metabolic genes with high association to pyrethroid
resistance

   Detoxification is a common pyrethroid resistance mechanism
   [[113]14,[114]15,[115]46–[116]48], and several key enzymes in this
   category are within the metabolic functional group. Overall,
   seventy-eight high association genes had predicted activity in
   metabolic processes, as shown in [117]Fig 2B ([118]S2 Table),
   (78/1053), hypergeometric test p value = 0.02). Though type I, or
   non-cyano group bearing pyrethroids, eg., permethrin, and type II, or
   alpha-cyano group bearing, eg., deltamethrin, have distinct toxicity
   mechanisms [[119]30], individual detoxification genes may respond to
   both types I and II [[120]49]. The major pyrethroid detoxification
   proteins are mixed function oxidases and alpha- and beta-esterases
   ([121]S2 Table) [[122]50,[123]51].

   In anophelines, an acetylcholine esterase resistant allele (ACE-1^R)
   can partially reduce deltamethrin sensitivity, and ace-1^R works
   synergistically with VGSC resistant alleles to substantially reduce
   sensitivity to permethrin [[124]52]. However, there is little data to
   indicate an association between selection of acetylcholine esterase
   alleles and permethrin resistance in Ae. aegypti. Nevertheless, two
   acetylcholine esterases were included in the high association group
   ([125]S2 Table, LOC5570776 and LOC5578456). Three genes coding for
   carboxylesterases (COEs, LOC5564561, LOC5576941, LOC5571034) were also
   in this group. COEs have been tied to organophosphate resistance
   mechanisms and, to a lesser extent, to deltamethrin resistance
   [[126]53]. In addition to supporting a role for these genes in
   pyrethroid detoxification, their presence in the common gene set is
   consistent with the idea that there may be some overlap between type I
   and II pyrethroid detoxification mechanisms. In contrast, there were no
   epilson class glutathione S transferases in the high association group,
   which is surprising, given that they have been shown to be pertinent to
   resistant phenotypes [[127]12,[128]14,[129]15,[130]54–[131]56].

   Over-representation of the metabolic gene category is consistent with
   studies in drosophilids wherein amino acid catabolism was tied to
   permethrin sensitivity [[132]57]. Specifically, Brinzer et al. found a
   decrease in proline levels in resistant larvae that had been exposed to
   permethrin, which could be explained by either increased conversion
   from proline to glutamate or inhibition of the proline precursor
   ornithine. Conversion of proline to glutamate has also been reported
   upon exposure to malathion or DDT [[133]58,[134]59]. In the current
   work, the aedine ortholog of 5-oxoprolinase, responsible for the
   degradation of glutamate, which would be required if it was in excess,
   is present in the high association group ([135]S2 Table) [[136]57].

   Additional metabolic pathway genes in the high association group
   included lipid biosynthetic genes ([137]S2 Table), for which
   transcripts are reportedly enriched in temephos-resistant mosquitoes
   [[138]60]. Interestingly, there were also multiple genes that
   participate in lipid metabolic processes, ie., 3 lipases and 4
   phospholipases ([139]S2 Table). Increased lipase activity has been tied
   to insecticide resistance in Tribolium spp [[140]61]. One possible
   explanation of this is that the catabolism of choline phospholipids is
   protective against the loss of choline, caused by the release of
   acetylcholine from synaptosomes [[141]62] and inhibition of acetyl
   cholinesterase [[142]63] that occurs in pyrethroid-susceptible insects.
   Similarly, a sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase (SMAse) activator domain
   protein was also in the high association group. SMAses are hydrolases
   that break down sphingomyelin into phosphocholine and ceramide
   (reviewed in [[143]64]).

   Some pyrethroid detoxification proteins are in the redox functional
   category. For our analyses, the redox and mitochondrial-associated gene
   subsets were combined, as key redox genes are localized to
   mitochondria. This category was not over-represented compared to all
   coding genes. Nevertheless, genes within this high association group
   included eighteen confirmed or putative CYPs, eight of which are CYP4c
   orthologs. CYP4c is an insect-specific member of the CYP4 family; CYP4
   family proteins are best known for oxidation of fatty acids and
   localize to peroxisomes and the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent work has
   also reported their involvement in permethrin resistance [[144]16].
   Though CYPs do not directly detoxify permethrin, they may function
   downstream of esterases, which are responsible for much of permethrin
   catabolism (reviewed in [[145]50]). Moreover, CYP6 and CYP9 ([146]S2
   Table) are also well documented for their involvement in resistance to
   both deltamethrin and permethrin [[147]48,[148]49].

   Though CYPs are the best studied of the redox functional group
   [[149]10,[150]11,[151]13,[152]15], mitochondrial function genes also
   have been implicated in permethrin resistant anopheline mosquitoes, as
   indicated by the presence of elevated reactive oxygen species
   [[153]46]. In addition, key electron transport gene cytochrome B (CYTB)
   transcripts are elevated in Ae.aegypti following permethrin treatment
   [[154]65], consistent with a requirement for increased mitochondrial
   function. Here, there were five genes coding for cytochrome B and C
   associated genes in the high association subset ([155]S2 Table).

Transport genes with high association to resistance

   The transport functional category was the most statistically
   significant of all over-represented categories evaluated (120/1053,
   hypergeometric test p value = 1.3 x 10^−6). This is intriguing, because
   one would not necessarily expect the category to be over-represented
   among all coding genes. Because the major pyrethroid target site, Vgsc,
   is a sodium transporter [[156]5,[157]66–[158]71], it is possible that
   off-target receptor/channel functions are perturbed upon pyrethroid
   exposure and thus selected. Indeed, 55 of 120 genes in this category
   code for transporter, receptor or channel proteins. An alternate
   possibility is that selection of transport genes represents
   compensatory mutations to restore overall membrane homeostasis
   disrupted by pyrethroid binding to Vgsc in polarized neuronal cells
   (reviewed in [[159]72]).

Repair/replication/transcription/translation genes

   The largest specific functional category was for genes that affect DNA
   replication/ repair/transcription/translation (RRTT) functions. About
   12.7% of all common genes were in this category, and though they were
   not over-represented relative to all coding genes (134/1053), there was
   a trend toward enrichment (hypergeometric test p value = 0.066). Of
   these genes, twenty are predicted to regulate transcription, including
   CHL, described above. Two orthologs of the transcription factor
   grauzone were also in this group. Grauzone is a Cys2His2 zinc-finger
   positive regulator of transcription and is required for meiosis in
   oogenesis [[160]73]. Its possible role in insecticide resistance is
   unknown.

   The effects of changes in transcriptional regulation of pyrethroid
   resistance are understudied in mosquitoes. Within the RRTT functional
   group, ribosomal protein subunits, histone proteins and histone
   methyltransferases were identified, hinting that insecticide resistance
   may require alterations from chromatin modifications to the initiation
   of gene expression to translational processes for establishment of the
   resistant phenotype.

Cytoskeletal/structural genes

   Cytoskeletal components are crucial to proper neuronal function
   (reviewed in [[161]74]). Genes coding for predicted
   cytoskeletal/structural function proteins were not over-represented
   among the subset common to all three collections. However, specific
   cytoskeletal/structural category genes with ankyrin domains are
   predicted to interact with Vgsc [[162]27,[163]28,[164]33] and are
   genetically associated with PARA^bss in Drosophila spp. [[165]27]. In
   addition, sickie (LOC5564933), a cytoskeletal positive regulator of
   neuronal axon growth, is also in the high association set [[166]75], as
   was β-spectrin (β-SPEC) ([167]S2 Table), a cytoskeletal protein
   important to maintaining neuronal structure in mammals and dipterans
   [[168]74,[169]76]. In mammals, β-SPEC is a neuronal structural
   component that physically interacts with N[AV] channels [[170]33] and
   also affects presynaptic stability [[171]33].

Signaling

   Genes with predicted function in cellular signaling were significantly
   over-represented (31/1053, hypergeometric probability p value = 0.013).
   G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) are suspected of activating
   expression of CYPs in permethrin resistant Culex quinquefasciatus
   [[172]77]. Twelve of 24 genes in this subset were among the high
   association set; these included GPCRs, GTP-binding proteins and
   GTPases. Second messenger signaling components are also important to
   overall control of cytoskeletal changes required for neural synapse
   function (reviewed in [[173]74]).

Genes with exceptionally high association levels

   To identify the highest resistance-associated genes among all treatment
   groups (VCP, VCD and VeP), genes among the top 10% of–log[10](p value)
   values in the high association set were identified. Values within this
   extreme group were all greater than 9.02, 7.95 and 9.85 for VCP, VCD
   and VeP, respectively. Thirteen genes, including VGSC, were within this
   subset, and eight of these were located on the p arm of chromosome 3,
   in the same region as VGSC. Therefore, extreme association on the 3p
   arm may be due to a selective sweep of VGSC, resulting in incidental
   selection of genes that have no functional association. However, if
   this was the case, we would expect a higher percentage of the 737 high
   association genes located on the chromosome 3p arm to be included in
   the extreme group. Specifically, the extreme association group
   represents just 1.7% of the VGSC -proximal high association cluster.
   This is consistent with the hypothesis that key genes within this
   subset are specifically selected due to functional attributes rather
   than by proximity to VGSC alone. Importantly, these observations do not
   negate the possibility of a selective sweep in this region.

   In addition to VGSC, the extreme association group included two
   transcriptional regulators (NERVY (NVY) LOC5563881 and LOC5579659), a
   Gr14 gustatory receptor (LOC5575007), a putative lipid binding protein,
   neural LAZARILLO (LOC5572156), CINGULIN (LOC5577979), a structural
   component of gap junctions at neuronal synapses [[174]78] and three
   hypothetical genes. LAZARILLO, a lipid-binding apolipoprotein, though
   not studied in mosquitoes, is a biomarker for deltamethrin liver
   toxicity in mammals [[175]79]. For all of these gene products, the
   mechanisms of association with pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes
   remain to be explored.

Genes associated with synaptic function

   Permethrin binding to the neuronal-specific transmembrane protein,
   Vgsc, could result in synaptic injury. The resulting toxic effects may
   select for mutations in genes that control pre- and post- synaptic
   processes. To explore this hypothesis, the high association group was
   interrogated for the presence of genes with known association to pre-
   and post-synaptic function. Twenty-one genes with demonstrated
   associations to this process were identified ([176]S2 Table)
   [[177]74,[178]80,[179]81]. Calcium signaling is requisite to motor
   neuron function [[180]82,[181]83], and the characteristic phenotype of
   pyrethroid treatment is the loss of motor control, due to insecticide
   binding to Vgsc. Therefore, the genetic association of both CAa1 and
   VGSC to pyrethroid resistance is consistent with complementary
   contributions of each protein toward motor synaptic function. In the
   drosophilid model, PARA expression is stimulated upon limiting synaptic
   activity levels [[182]83]. Consistent with these observations, the
   translational repressor, PUM, helps regulate motoneuronal activity, a
   function that is conserved in mammals and dipterans [[183]84,[184]85].
   It does this via control of VGSC (PARA) translation, thus regulating
   synaptic excitation [[185]83]. Of note, PUM was also present in our
   high association set, consistent with a role in the selection of
   resistance ([186]S2 Table). Synaptotagmins were another gene cluster
   associated with synaptic function; these genes code for synaptic
   vesicle calcium sensors ([187]S2 Table) [[188]86] that interact with
   N[AV] in mammals [[189]87].

   Neuronal cytoskeletal genes are crucial to maintenance of synaptic
   control (reviewed in [[190]74]). Several cytoskeletal and associated
   regulatory genes important to synaptic activity were in the high
   association set ([191]S2 Table), including an atypical protein kinase C
   (aPKC) ortholog (LOC5576493). aPKC stabilizes the microtubule
   cytoskeleton for proper synaptic function (reviewed in [[192]74]).
   β-SPEC is an important structural feature of synaptic connections
   [[193]35] and interacts with N[AV] channels in mammals [[194]88].
   Moreover, neuroligin-1 was also present in the high association group,
   also consistent with selection at excitatory synapses [[195]89].

Conclusions

   We identified gene subsets with significant enrichment in populations
   resistant to pyrethroids. Importantly, genes were also identified that
   genetically, functionally or physically interact with Vgsc in other
   model organisms or in cell culture. Genes which were present in the
   high association set and for which multiple lines of evidence support
   genetic or physical interactions with VGSC are highlighted in [196]Fig
   5 [[197]25,[198]26,[199]28,[200]32,[201]33,[202]37]. We also found that
   aedine transcriptional regulators CHL and NVY are associated with
   permethrin resistant phenotypes. This is consistent with the hypothesis
   that transcriptional processes are under selective pressure. Both CHL
   and NVY are located on the p arm of chromosome 3 (red arrows, [203]Fig
   3) near VGSC within the area of a proposed selective sweep. The
   functional associations described in this report are consistent with
   the idea that specific genes within the VGSC-proximal cluster are
   associated with resistant phenotypes, are under selective pressure, and
   are not selected merely due to chromosomal proximity.

   due to shared roles in synaptic function. Blue line indicates genetic
   association in drosophilids. Red line indicates genetic evidence in

   mammals.

   One explanation for over-representation of the “Transport” functional
   group is that polarized neuronal cells are more sensitive to alteration
   of transport functions and therefore under selective pressure in
   pyrethroid treatment areas. Mosquitoes may develop compensatory
   mutations in genes coding for transport proteins in an effort to reduce
   cell toxicity caused by synaptic damage. Though not studied in
   dipterans, patch clamp analyses of rat Na[v]1.8 sodium channel isoform
   in Xenopus oocytes indicated that membrane depolarization was not
   significantly impacted by permethrin or deltamethrin treatment, however
   there were significant decreases in calcium influx and glutamate
   release that were similar for both permethrin and deltamethrin
   [[224]30]. Thus, taken together with the evidence above, we hypothesize
   that, in addition to VGSC, channels/transporters involved in glutamate
   and calcium homeostasis are major drivers of selection of transport
   category genes that contribute to resistance.

   The genetic associations identified here need to be more
   comprehensively validated in mosquitoes to further support their roles
   in pyrethroid resistance.

Materials and methods

Collections and bioassays

   Both populations used for this work were from the Merida region of
   Yucatan, Mexico and were collected from locations that were 13
   kilometers apart. Population #1 was from Viva Caucel (20°59'57.83"N
   89°42'15.41"W) was collected in 2011 by María Alba Loroño-Pino and
   Julian García-Rejón of Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán. The original
   larval collection (n = 60) was obtained from ~20 containers; more
   details are reported in Saavedrea-Rodriguez et al. 2015 [[225]7].
   Progeny from this collection was reared two generations in the
   laboratory. The third generation (about 3000 eggs) was reared to
   adulthood; a subset ([226]Table 1) was exposed to permethrin-coated
   bottles using an amount that approximated the LC[50] (lethal
   concentration, 50%, 25 μg per bottle active ingredient, Chem Service,
   West Chester, PA) [[227]8]. Bioassays consisted of treatment of ~50
   female mosquitoes (3–4 days old) for one hour [[228]45]. Active
   mosquitoes, which were not knocked down (resistant), were transferred
   to cardboard cups and frozen at -80ᵒC. Mosquitoes that were knocked
   down were transferred to a second cardboard cup and placed into an
   incubator at 28ᵒC and 70% humidity. After a four hour recovery period,
   mosquitoes that remained inactive were scored as susceptible. DNA was
   isolated from individual mosquitoes using a salt extraction method
   [[229]91] and resuspended in 150 μl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM
   EDTA pH 8.0). We typically isolate DNA from individual mosquitoes for
   archival purposes. For the current work, individual mosquito DNAs were
   carefully measured to allow for equimolar amounts of each mosquito in
   the sequencing libraries (see below).

   Population #2 was also from Viva Caucel and was treated in bottles
   coated with 3 μg deltamethrin, also the LC[50], using the same scheme
   as described above. Population #3 was from Vergel, Yucatán State in
   Southern Mexico (20°57'30.08"N, 89°35'4.33"W). It was also collected in
   2011 by Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán and had been through two
   generations in the laboratory. The original larval collection (n = 47)
   was sampled from ~20 container sites [[230]7]. Progeny (about 3000
   eggs) from the 3^rd generation of this collection was reared to
   adulthood; a subset ([231]Table 1) were treated with permethrin, using
   the same conditions, as described above for population #1.

Gene silencing/bioassays

   A 500 base-pair region of CHL or NVY was synthesized and inserted into
   a bacterial plasmid, pUC-IDT[kan](Integrated DNA technologies). dsRNAs
   were generated using T7 primers appended to gene-specific primers,
   using the methods of Campbell et al. [[232]92], wherein T7 dsDNA was
   prepared from synthesized gene fragments, and dsRNA was subsequently
   transcribed from the dsDNA. All primers are listed in [233]S3 Table.
   Three to seven day old Vergel colony mosquitoes (F[24]) were injected
   with ~400 ng dsRNA and assayed at 3 days post-injection. Gene silencing
   was validated by qRT-PCR. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from pools
   of 5 mosquitoes (Qiagen RNAEasy kit), and 10 ng RNA was used as input
   into each 20 μl qRT-PCR reaction (NovaScript, Qiagen). Data was
   compiled from at least three biological replicates and three technical
   replicates for each treatment group. Average values for amplified
   ribosomal protein S7 (RPS7) and aaeACTIN were used for normalizing
   quantitation of relative expression using the delta-delta Ct relative
   gene expression calculation, relative to β-Gal-dsRNA injected control
   mosquitoes. At 3 days-post-injection, pools of mosquitoes were
   subjected to standard CDC bottle assays [[234]45] using the
   discriminating dose of 1.5 μg permethrin per bottle (Sigma-Aldrich).
   Because the colony had been maintained for 24 generations in the lab
   without permethrin selection, the population had regained substantial
   sensitivity to insecticide treatment. Knockdown was measured in 10
   minute increments for one hour, and mortality was scored at 24 hours
   post-treatment. Knockdown data represent a compilation of 5
   experimental replicates.

Pooling and quantification of samples

   For each location/treatment group, gDNA from 25 resistant females was
   pooled for each of two replicates; similarly gDNA from 2 pools of 25
   susceptible females was prepared. Before pooling, DNA from each
   individual mosquito was quantified using the Quant-IT Pico Green kit
   (Life Technologies) and ~40 ng from each individual DNA sample (25
   individuals per library) was used for a final DNA pool of 1 μg. A
   Covaris S2 sonicator (Covaris Ltd, Brighton UK) sheared pooled DNA to
   an average size of 500 bp. Sonication conditions were: duty cycle 10%,
   Intensity 5.0, Cycles per burst 200, Duration 40 seconds, Mode
   Frequency sweeping, Displayed Power 23W, Temperature 5.5° - 6°C. Each
   TruSeq DNA LT (v.2) library was prepared using 1 μg of sheared genomic
   DNA following manufacturer’s recommendations. We prepared one library
   for each of the twelve DNA pools following the Illumina TruSeq DNA
   Sample preparation guide (Illumina, San Diego CA).

   Equimolar quantities of prepared libraries were pooled and enriched for
   coding sequences by exome capture using custom SeqCap EZ Developer
   probes (Nimblegen) [[235]19]. In total, 26.7Mb of the genome (2%) was
   targeted for enrichment, as described elsewhere [[236]20]. Overlapping
   probes covering the protein coding sequence (not including UTRs) in the
   AaegL1.3 gene annotations
   ([237]https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/aedes-aegypti/liverpool-lvp/
   AaegL1.3) were produced by Nimblegen. Enrichment followed the Nimblegen
   SeqCap EZ protocol. Briefly, pooled TruSeq libraries were hybridized to
   the probes for 64 hours at 47°C, unbound DNA was washed away, and the
   targeted DNA was eluted and amplified. These were then sequenced on 2
   lanes of a HiSeq2500 (Illumina) for paired-end 2 x 100 nt sequencing by
   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Control in Atlanta,
   GA, producing reads with quality scores > 30.

Bioinformatics

Alignments and population genetics pipeline

   The analytical methods reported here have been used previously to
   identify polymorphic differences between aedine subspecies and
   sex-specific polymorphisms [[238]19,[239]93]. Though the published
   versions of the papers reported F[ST] values rather than contingency
   χ^2 –log[10](p values), preliminary analyses of–log[10](p values)
   showed trends identical to those in the published reports. Importantly,
   the sex-specific polymorphisms we described were also replicated
   independently by others [[240]94]. All raw reads were trimmed of
   adapters and filtered using cutadapt [[241]95]. The AaegL5 genome build
   [[242]21] of 18,081 coding and non-coding genes was used, including all
   5’UTRs, exons, introns, 3’UTRs. The 5’ and 3’ non-transcribed regions
   in previously reported alignments were excluded [[243]19]. Individual
   replicate trimmed fastq files were aligned to a custom reference file
   using GSNAP (version 2013-10-28), allowing 10% divergence [[244]96].
   GSNAP outputs were converted to *.mpileup files, using SAMtools
   [[245]97]. The “readcounts” command in Varscan2 (v2.3.5) [[246]98] was
   used to convert *.mpileup files to readcounts output, using the
   following options:—min-coverage 15—min-base-qual 30. FORTRAN programs
   used in this analysis are available upon request. The number of aligned
   reads was determined in .bam files, using SAMtools flagstat and
   multiplied by the read-length (100 nt) to achieve the total nucleotides
   aligned. The ratio of variant sites per chromosome was multiplied by
   1000 and divided by the total aligned nucleotides ([247]S1 Table) to
   obtain the “Ratio sites/aligned nucleotide * 1000.”

   Because the probes were designed using genome build L1.3, and the
   current reference genome is L5, we checked one of the libraries
   (VCDA-rep1) to determine the percentage and depth of sequencing for
   capture target sequences that aligned to L5. Coverage depth files of
   .bam files were generated using SAMtools, then the analogous L5 capture
   coordinate intervals were located. About 15.3% (chr 1), 6.5% (chr 2),
   and 11.7% (chr 3) of L5 capture targets were not either not sequenced
   or had coverage less than the 15 read coverage cut-off. In addition, a
   blastn search of L5 transcripts using the capture probes indicated that
   they cover (13,942/18,081) 77% of the genes in L5.

   All sequencing data generated under this project are available at the
   National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read
   Archive, Bioproject accession number PRJNA393171. VCPA
   permethrin-treated resistant replicates 1 and 2 are SRR5805471 and
   SRR5805472, respectively. VCPD permethrin-treated susceptible
   replicates 1 and 2 are SRR5805473 and SRR5805470, respectively. VCDA
   deltamethrin-treated resistant replicates 1 and 2 are SRR5805467 and
   SRR5805466, respectively. VCDD deltamethrin-treated susceptible
   replicates 1 and 2 are SRR5805469 and SRR5805468, respectively. VePA
   permethrin-treated resistant replicates 1 and 2 are SRR5805465 and
   SRR5805464, respectively. VePD permethrin-treated susceptible
   replicates 1 and 2 are SRR5805475 and SRR5805474, respectively.

   In-house FORTRAN scripts were used to calculate heterogeneity χ^2
   values with degrees of freedom equal to the number of alternate
   nucleotides minus 1. The contingency χ^2 calculation tested for the
   presence of an alternate nucleotide at each position along the genome
   and computed a -log[10](p value) at each SNP [[248]19]. For the purpose
   of highlighting genes with high statistical association to pyrethroid
   resistance, calculations of weighted gene-wise average scores were made
   by determining the mean of the top 5% -log[10](p value) values per
   gene. Our rationale for this calculation was as follows. Along the
   length of a given coding sequence, many nucleotide sites showed little
   change relative to the reference sequence, thus resulting in many
   -log[10](p value)at or near zero for a given SNP. Coding changes
   indicative of selection toward pyrethroid resistance may be present in
   a small subset of sites relative to the full length gene. Therefore, a
   weighted average allowed us to identify those genes with localized high
   value SNPs. Statistical significance was determined using the
   Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate [[249]22] (FDR, alpha = 0.01)
   and a cut-off of 4.0 was established for gene-wise averages.

   Gene annotations were obtained from Vectorbase [[250]23] using BioMart.
   Functional groups were assigned to the following categories:
   ‘apoptosis’(APOP); ‘chemosensory response‘ (CSR);
   cytoskeletal/structural (CYT/STR); ‘diverse’ (DIV) for genes with
   multiple or less clearly defined function(s); ‘mitochondrial’ (MIT) for
   gene products localized to mitochondrial compartment, regardless of
   function; (LIPID) for genes with predicted function in lipid processing
   or biosynthesis; (ReDox) for genes with predicted function in
   oxidation/reduction processes; proteolysis or proteosomal activity
   (PROT); replication/(DNA)repair/transcription /translation’ (RRTT);
   signal transduction (SigT); metabolism (MET); ‘unknown’ (UNK) for
   uncharacterized genes. Finally, the ‘transport’ (TRP) category included
   all gene products predicted to be involved in moving molecules across
   membranes, including receptors, exclusive of secondary messengers and
   signaling receptors. For GSEA, the mitochondrial and redox categories
   were combined, as several key redox activities occur in proteins
   localized to mitochondria.

Statistics

   Descriptive statistics were calculated in R (version 3.0.2). The ratio
   of variant sites per nucleotide of aligned reads was calculated as
   follows: binomial probability distributions were performed and
   hypergeometric tests were calculated; each functional subset was
   compared to the corresponding group within the set of all coding genes
   (n = 14,626). This analysis allowed us to identify the gene sets that
   were enriched compared to similar categories among all coding genes.
