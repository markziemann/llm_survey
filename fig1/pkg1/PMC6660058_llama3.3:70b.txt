Here are the answers to the questions:

1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used for pathway enrichment analysis.

2. Was a tool version number provided?
No, the version number of IPA was not described.

3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?
Not described, but it is mentioned that IPA was used to estimate canonical pathways, downstream effects, and potential upstream regulators.

4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described.

5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?
Not described, but it is mentioned that cutoff values for gene expression results greater than Â± 1.5-fold-change were used to select genes for further analysis.

6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described.
