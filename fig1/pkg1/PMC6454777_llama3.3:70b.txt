Here are the answers to the questions:

1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described

2. Was a tool version number provided?
Not described

3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?
Not described, but it is mentioned that "meta-analysis of data retrieved from NCBI GEO database" was used to analyze the expression of catabolic and anabolic enzymes.

4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described

5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?
Not described, but it is mentioned that "Z-score values" were used to calculate the cumulative changes in the expression of catabolic and anabolic enzymes.

6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described

Note: The article does not provide detailed information on the pathway enrichment analysis methodology, so most of the answers are "Not described".
