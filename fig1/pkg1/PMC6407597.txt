ABSTRACT

   Airway epithelial cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) under
   basal conditions and when exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE).
   Getting insights into the composition of these EVs will help unravel
   their functions in homeostasis and smoking-induced pathology. Here, we
   characterized the proteomic composition of basal and CSE-induced airway
   epithelial EVs. BEAS-2B cells were left unexposed or exposed to 1% CSE
   for 24 h, followed by EV isolation using ultrafiltration and size
   exclusion chromatography. Isolated EVs were labelled with tandem mass
   tags and their proteomic composition was determined using
   nano-LC-MS/MS. Tissue factor (TF) activity was determined by a factor
   Xa generation assay, phosphatidylserine (PS) content by prothrombinase
   assay and thrombin generation using calibrated automated thrombogram
   (CAT). Nano-LC-MS/MS identified 585 EV-associated proteins with high
   confidence. Of these, 201 were differentially expressed in the CSE-EVs
   according to the moderated t-test, followed by false discovery rate
   (FDR) adjustment with the FDR threshold set to 0.1. Functional
   enrichment analysis revealed that 24 proteins of the pathway
   haemostasis were significantly up-regulated in CSE-EVs, including TF.
   Increased TF expression on CSE-EVs was confirmed by bead-based flow
   cytometry and was associated with increased TF activity. CSE-EVs caused
   faster and more thrombin generation in normal human plasma than
   control-EVs, which was partly TF-, but also PS-dependent. In
   conclusion, proteomic analysis allowed us to predict procoagulant
   properties of CSE-EVs which were confirmed in vitro. Cigarette
   smoke-induced EVs may contribute to the increased cardiovascular and
   respiratory risk observed in smokers.

Introduction

   Tobacco consumption forms an important risk factor for several chronic
   diseases including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD) and cardiovascular disease [[47]1]. We and others have shown
   that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) causes increased release of
   extracellular vesicles (EVs) by different cell types in vitro
   [[48]2–[49]5]. Moreover, smokers have increased concentrations of
   circulating EVs in vivo [[50]4,[51]6,[52]7]. These EVs are secreted
   membrane vesicles, which are either derived from the plasma membrane
   (microvesicles) or from multivesicular endosomes (exosomes). Both types
   of EVs carry a versatile cargo of lipids, nucleotides and proteins, and
   have been ascribed multiple functions in homeostasis as well as
   pathologies [[53]8].

   The functions of EVs released by smoke-exposed monocytes and
   macrophages are relatively well studied. These EVs have been proposed
   to promote inflammation [[54]3], proteolysis [[55]9] and coagulation
   [[56]10]. However, EV functions can differ depending on the EV type,
   the secreting cell and its physiological state [[57]11,[58]12].
   Although the airway epithelium forms the first line of contact with
   inhaled cigarette smoke, studies on the functions of EVs released by
   smoke-exposed airway epithelial cells are scarce. Previously, we have
   shown that airway epithelial cells secrete small EVs (mode size 110 nm)
   expressing the tetraspanins CD63, CD81 and CD9, at control conditions
   and when exposed to CSE [[59]5,[60]13]. In this study, we aimed to
   predict the functions of these EVs. For this purpose, we isolated EVs
   from conditioned media of unexposed or CSE-exposed airway epithelial
   cells using a combination of ultrafiltration and size exclusion
   chromatography (SEC). We then labelled the isolated EVs with tandem
   mass tags and performed a quantitative proteomic analysis using
   nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry
   (nano-LC-MS/MS), with the hypothesis that EV functions can be predicted
   based on their proteomic content.

Materials and methods

   We have submitted all relevant data of our experiments to the EV-TRACK
   knowledgebase (EV-TRACK ID: [61]EV180060) [[62]14].

Cell culture and exposure

   BEAS-2B airway epithelial cells (ATCC CRL-9609) were cultured in RPMI
   1640 with 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum (FCS, Lonza) and all cell culture
   flasks or plates were precoated with fibronectin as described
   previously [[63]5]. For flow cytometric analysis of EVs or cells,
   2 × 10^5 cells per well were seeded on a 12-well plate (Costar) and for
   EV-isolations, 4 × 10^6 cells were seeded per T75 (Costar) and allowed
   to attach overnight. After 2 h incubation in reduction medium (DMEM-F12
   without phenol-red (Gibco) supplemented with 0.1% EV-depleted FCS),
   cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before
   1 ml (12-well plate) or 20 ml (T75) of reduction medium and either 1%
   (v/v) PBS (vehicle control) or 1% (v/v) CSE was added. For EV
   isolations, three T75 cell culture flasks and a total medium volume of
   60 ml were used per condition, except for nano-LC-MS/MS, where six T75
   and 120 ml were used.

   EV-depleted FCS was obtained by diluting FCS to 30% (v/v) in DMEM-F12
   without phenol-red followed by 16 h centrifugation at 40,000 rpm
   (average RCF = 117,734 × g, k-Factor 133.7), in a fixed-angle Type
   70Ti-rotor in an Optima L-90K preparative ultracentrifuge
   (Beckman-Coulter). The supernatant was collected without disturbing the
   concentrated layer at the bottom of the tube. This procedure resulted
   in a 45.5 ± 6.8-fold reduction of particles in the size range of
   80–250 nm, from 3.7 ± 0.7 × 10^9 to 7.8 ± 1.3 × 10^7 particles/ml,
   according to tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS; n = 2).

   CSE was generated using an in-house smoking device with silicone
   tubing. The mainstream smoke of one cigarette (Reference Cigarette
   3R4F, Tobacco-Health Research, University of Kentucky) without filter
   was drawn through 2 ml PBS in a polypropylene tube using a vacuum-pump
   at constant speed. The obtained solution was filtered through a 0.22 µm
   Acrodisk filter (Pall) for sterility and defined as 100% CSE. CSE was
   only used when the cigarette was completely smoked within 6–8 min and
   when the delta OD (OD[320] [nm] − OD[540] [nm]) of 100 µl 100% CSE was
   between 0.9 and 1.2. CSE was prepared freshly for each experiment and
   used within 15 min.

EV isolation

   EV isolation was performed by a combination of 10 kDa ultrafiltration
   and sepharose CL-4B SEC as described previously [[64]13]. In brief,
   60 ml of conditioned media were concentrated to 500 μl on an Amicon
   Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel 10 membrane (10 kDa
   MWCO, Merck Millipore), followed by separation of EVs and free protein
   by SEC on a 10 ml sepharose CL4B column into 24 fractions of 0.5 ml.
   The EV-containing SEC fractions (7–10) as well as the
   protein-containing SEC fractions (13–19) were then pooled and
   concentrated to 250 μl on an Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit
   with Ultracel 10 membrane (10 kDa MWCO, Merck Millipore) to obtain EV
   isolates and protein concentrates, respectively. The entire isolation
   protocol was also applied to unconditioned media in order to obtain
   unconditioned media isolates, i.e. fractions 7–10 from media that were
   incubated for 24 h with 1% (v/v) PBS or CSE in the absence of cells.

Characterization of EV size and morphology

   The morphology and size of the isolated EVs were visualized by
   cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) as described
   previously [[65]13]. Additionally, the EV size distribution and
   concentration were determined by TRPS. TRPS was performed using a qNano
   Gold with Izon Control Suite 3.2 Software and SKP200 calibration beads
   (Izon, Chirstchurch, New Zealand). EV isolates were analysed after a
   single freeze-thaw cycle at −80°C. Where possible, at least 500
   blockades were detected per sample. To enable comparability between the
   different recordings, the pore stretch was adjusted to obtain a
   relative particle size of 0.65 for the SKP200 calibration beads, and
   the voltage was adjusted to obtain a current between 125 and 130 nA. A
   size filter from 80 to 250 nm was applied for determining EV
   concentrations.

Processing of EV-associated protein, nano-LC–MS/MS and database search

   Isolated EVs (500 μl, obtained from 120 ml of conditioned media) were
   acetone-precipitated as described previously [[66]13]. Five microgram
   of precipitated protein per sample was incubated for 1 h at 55°C with
   50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB; Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mM
   tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Next,
   protein was alkylated by incubation with 17 mM iodoacetic acid (IAA,
   Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Samples were
   then incubated with six volumes of ice-cold acetone at −20°C overnight
   before centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The dried pellet
   was resuspended in 50 μl of 100 mM TEAB and samples were incubated with
   20 ng/μl trypsin/endoproteinase lysC (Promega) for 2 h at 37°C. After
   addition of 75 μl 100 mM TEAB, samples were incubated for another 18 h
   at 37°C. Finally, samples were stained using the TMT10plex™ Isobaric
   Label Reagent Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to
   manufacturer’s protocol. Twenty microlitres from each of the 10 samples
   (five control isolates and five CSE isolates) was pooled.

   A nanoflow high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument
   (Dionex ultimate 300) was coupled on-line to a Q Exactive (Thermo
   Scientific) with a nano-electrospray Flex ion source (Proxeon). The
   final concentration of the TMT-labelled digest/peptide mixture was 0.2
   μg/μl and 5 μl of this mixture was loaded onto a C18-reversed phase
   column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Acclaim PepMap C18 column, 75 μm
   inner diameter × 15 cm, 5 μm particle size). The peptides were
   separated with a 90 min linear gradient of 4–45% buffer B (80%
   acetonitrile and 0.08% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.

   The mass spectrometry data acquisition and the data base search were
   performed using the Sequest HT Proteome Discoverer 2.1 as described
   previously [[67]13], except that the resolution for HCD spectra was set
   to 35,000 and TMT reagent adducts (+229.162932 Da) on lysine and
   peptide amino termini were set as fixed modifications. Sample
   abundances were normalized to obtain an equal total peptide amount for
   all 10 samples. The raw data of the nano-LC-MS/MS analyses have been
   deposited to the public database ProteomeXchange (Project number:
   PXD006738). Proteins identified with a false discovery rate (FDR) <
   0.01 were considered of high confidence and included for downstream
   analysis.

EV detection using bead-based flow cytometry

   All antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. EVs were detected by
   bead-based flow cytometry as described previously with some adaptations
   [[68]5]. Beads (3.5 × 10^8/ml; 4 μm aldehyde/sulphate latex beads;
   Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with 0.125 mg/ml of mouse
   anti-human CD63 antibody (Clone H5C6), anti-human CD81 (clone JS-81),
   anti-human CD9 (Clone M-L13), or an equal mixture of all three
   antibodies by overnight incubation in MES buffer on a shaker at 6500
   rpm. Coated beads were stored in PBS-containing 0.1% (m/v) glycine and
   0.1% (m/v) sodium azide at 4°C until use. Before use, beads were washed
   with PBS-containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). Then, 1 × 10^6
   beads were incubated overnight with either 200 μl of conditioned cell
   culture media or 200 μl of isolated EVs suspended in PBS at a
   concentration of 2 × 10^8 particles/ml based on TRPS. Detection was
   performed as described previously [[69]5] with either of the following
   phycoerythrin (PE)-labelled antibodies: (Clone H5C6), anti-human CD81
   (clone JS-81), anti-human CD9 (Clone M-L13) or anti-human tissue factor
   (TF; clone HTF-1). Alternatively, beads were stained for 15 min at room
   temperature with 50 μl of Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488) conjugated annexin V
   (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 50× in annexin binding buffer (ABB)
   in order to detect phosphatidylserine (PS). Stained beads were
   suspended in 150 μl PBS (antibody staining) or ABB (annexin V staining)
   and analysed using a BD FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) with FACS Diva
   V8.0.1 software (BD Biosciences). The quantity of EVs in relative
   fluorescent units (RFU) was calculated by multiplying the percentage of
   PE or AF488-positive beads with the median fluorescent intensity (MFI)
   of the positive bead population.

Cell viability and detection of cell surface-exposed TF and PS

   BEAS-2B cells (2 × 10^5) were incubated with 1% (v/v) PBS or CSE on
   12-well plates (Costar). After 24 h, cell viability was assessed by
   methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described
   previously [[70]5]. Alternatively, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
   (EDTA, 250 mM, pH 6.14) was added to the wells to a final concentration
   of 10 mM and incubated for 10 min at 37°C. Cells were then gently
   detached by pipetting and sedimented by centrifugation (400 × g,
   7 min).

   For detection of cell surface-exposed PS, cells were resuspended in 70
   μl ABB with 3.6% (v/v) AF488-labelled annexin V (AnxV) and 1 μg/ml
   propidium iodide (PI). After incubation for 15 min at room temperature,
   100 μl of ABB was added, followed by immediate measurement using a BD
   FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) with FACS Diva V8.0.1 software (BD
   Biosciences). The percentages of AnxV^−PI^− (live, no cell
   surface-exposed PS), AnxV^+PI^− (apoptotic, cell surface-exposed PS)
   and AnxV^+PI^+ (dead, impaired membrane integrity) were determined.

   For TF detection, pelleted cells were resuspended in 100 μl PBS with 2%
   (w/v) BSA and 2% (v/v) PE-labelled mouse anti-human TF (clone HTF-1, BD
   Biosciences) or PE-labelled isotype control (clone MPC-21, BD
   Biosciences). After 45 min incubation at room temperature with gentle
   shaking, cells were sedimented at 400 × g for 7 min, followed by
   resuspension in 150 μl PBS and measurement using a BD FACSCanto II (BD
   Biosciences) with FACS Diva V8.0.1 software (BD Biosciences). The gate
   was set so that 2% of the isotype-stained cells had a positive
   PE-signal.

Blood collection and processing for the normal human plasma pool

   Blood collection was performed as described previously with some
   adaptations [[71]15]. Written informed consent was obtained from all
   participants, and the study was approved by the institutional ethics
   committee of the Maastricht UMC+. Venous blood was collected from 122
   healthy volunteers through antecubital venipuncture using 21-gauge
   needles, one discarding tube and four consecutive 3.2% (w/v) citrated
   Vacutainer glass tubes (BD). Blood was centrifuged at 2000 × g for
   5 min, followed by a second centrifugation step at 5000 × g for 10 min
   to obtain platelet poor plasma (PPP). PPP from all donors was pooled
   and aliquots of the thus obtained normal human plasma pool were
   snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use.

Assessing procoagulant effects of EVs

   For blocking surface-exposed PS, 2.5 × 10^9 EVs/ml were incubated for
   30 min at 37°C with 10 μg/ml annexin V (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 50
   μl PBS with 10% (v/v) 10× ABB. Controls were mock-treated with 50 μl
   PBS with 10% (v/v) 10× ABB. EVs were then stored at −80°C.

   TF activity was determined using an in house factor Xa generation assay
   as described previously [[72]16]. The assay is based on the principle
   that active TF forms a complex with factor VIIa, which activates factor
   X to Xa in the presence of Ca^2+ and phospholipids. In brief, isolated
   EVs (7.5 × 10^6) and standards were incubated for 10 min at 37°C in the
   presence of recombinant factor VIIa (Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark),
   0.2 mM 20/80 PS/phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles (prepared in house
   using phospholipids from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.), 1 U/ml Bovine FX
   (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 mM Ca^2+. The formation of factor Xa was then
   measured kinetically using the chromogenic substrate 2765 (Chromogenix,
   final concentration of 0.7 mg/ml diluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 175 nM
   NaCl, 30 mM Na[2]EDTA, pH 7.4) by measuring the OD at 405 nm each 15 s,
   for 15 min at 37°C.

   PS-dependent thrombin generation was determined using an in-house
   prothrombinase assay. In the presence of negatively charged
   phospholipids, such as PS, factor Va and factor Xa assemble to form the
   active prothrombinase complex, which converts prothrombin into its
   active form thrombin. A reaction mix of 5 mg/ml BSA, 1.0 nM bovine
   factor Va, 0.05 nM bovine factor Xa and 5 mM CaCl[2] was prepared in
   HEPES-NaCl (HN) buffer (25 mM HEPES and 175 mM NaCl, pH 7.7 at room
   temperature). Ten microlitres of phospholipid standard (10% PS, 90% PC;
   ranging from 10 to 250 nM), mock-treated EVs or annexin V-treated EVs
   (5 × 10^8 particles/ml) were added to 190 μl of the reaction mix. After
   10 min incubation, human prothrombin (Haematologic Technologies
   Incorporated) was added to a final concentration of 500 nM and
   incubated for 1 min. Next, 50 μl was subsampled and transferred to 150
   μl cuvette buffer (50 mM Tris, 175 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml
   ovalbumin, pH 7.9) and incubated for 7 min 37°C. Thereafter, 50 μl of
   the thrombin substrate S2238 (Chromogenix) was added and the absorption
   at 405 and 490 nm was measured every 30 s for 15 min.

   Thrombin generation in human plasma was determined by the calibrated
   automated thrombogram method (CAT, Thrombinoscope BV). Untreated,
   mock-treated or annexin V-treated control-EVs or CSE-EVs (2 × 10^8 or
   1 × 10^8) were added to 70 μl of normal pooled PPP in the presence or
   absence of 30 nM of the TF inhibitor active site inhibited factor VIIa
   (ASIS). The total reaction volume was 120 μl and measurements were
   performed as described previously [[73]17].

Data analysis

   [74]Figure 1 is a flow chart summarizing the data analysis steps
   performed on the proteomics data. The method published by Kammers et
   al. was used to detect significant changes in protein abundance between
   control-EVs and CSE-induced EVs [[75]18] using the limma
   packageV3.32.10 in R V3.4.1 with R studio [[76]19]. Abundance values of
   proteins identified by the Sequest HT Proteome Discoverer 2.1 with an
   FDR <0.01 were imported into R. The log2 of the abundances was then
   calculated. Subsequently, the median log2 abundance of each protein was
   subtracted from each individual abundance value of that protein (n = 5
   for control-EVs and n = 5 for CSE-induced EVs) to obtain a normalized
   protein abundance with a median of 0. A moderated t-test was then
   performed to test for statistically significant differences in protein
   abundance between the control-EVs and the CSE-EVs using a slight
   modification of the code published by Kammers et al [[77]18]
   (Supplemental file 1). This included calculation of the p-value of the
   moderated t-test as well as transformation into q-values according to
   the method of Storey and Tibshirani [[78]20]. Proteins that showed a
   differential expression with a q-value (i.e. FDR) < 0.1 were included
   for downstream functional enrichment analysis for gene ontology (GO)
   terms and biological pathways. Functional enrichment analysis by
   hypergeometric test was performed using FunRich software version 2.1.2
   and the human-specific integrated FunRich background database [[79]21].
   For the functional enrichment analysis, the FDR was set to 0.01.
   Functional enrichment was determined for GO terms from the three GO
   domains “cellular component”, “molecular function” and “biological
   process” as well as for biological pathways. The protein dataset was
   subdivided into three subsets: (1) proteins that were unchanged in
   CSE-EVs compared to control-EVs, (2) proteins that were significantly
   up-regulated and (3) proteins that were significantly down-regulated in
   CSE-EVs. GO terms and biological pathways were selected for display in
   the results section if they showed a strong enrichment in all three
   subsets or if they showed strong differences in enrichment between the
   subsets.

Results

Difference in proteomic composition between CSE-induced EVs and control-EVs

   To determine functionally relevant differences in the proteomic
   composition of EVs from unexposed or CSE-exposed BEAS-2B airway
   epithelial cells, cells were either left untreated or exposed to 1%
   (v/v) CSE for 24 h. Exposure to CSE resulted in a moderate decrease in
   cell metabolic activity as determined by MTT assay ([81]Figure 2(a)).
   This was associated with an increased release of EVs according to TRPS
   ([82]Figure 2(b)). Bead-based flow cytometry using a cocktail of
   antibodies against the EV marker proteins CD63, CD81 and CD9 confirmed
   that there was an overall increase in EV concentration in conditioned
   media of CSE-exposed cells ([83]Figure 2(c)). Staining for each
   individual marker protein revealed that the overall increase in EV
   concentration was driven by CD81^+ and CD9^+ but not CD63^+ EVs
   ([84]Figure 2(c)). The differential up-regulation of some, but not all
   tested marker proteins is suggestive of compositional changes.

   EVs were isolated using a combination of ultrafiltration and SEC as
   described previously [[86]13]. Size and morphology of isolated
   control-EVs and CSE-EVs were similar according to cryo-TEM ([87]Figure
   3(a-c)) and TRPS ([88]Figure 3(d)). Isolated EVs (n = 5) were
   precipitated, followed by protein digestion, isobaric labelling and
   quantitative proteomic analysis. By nano-LC-MS/MS, 732 proteins were
   identified, including 633 with high FDR confidence (q < 0.01), which
   were tested for differential expression in CSE-EVs (Supplemental file
   2). No p-values could be calculated for 48 proteins due to too many
   missing values, resulting in p-values for 585 proteins. The p-value
   histogram in [89]Figure 4a shows that there were true differences in
   protein abundance between CSE-EVs and control-EVs as illustrated by the
   clear peak for p-values < 0.05. All 585 p-values were transformed to
   q-values for FDR adjustment. The volcano plot in [90]Figure 4(b) shows
   that 26.3% of proteins were significantly up-regulated and 8.0%
   significantly down-regulated in the CSE-EVs (q < 0.1).

   To identify functional changes in the EV composition due to CSE
   exposure, the 585 proteins were divided into three subsets: proteins
   that were unchanged (384; 65.6%), up-regulated (154; 26.3%) or
   down-regulated (47; 8.0%) in CSE-EVs ([93]Figure 5(a)). For the total
   dataset, as well as the three subsets, functional enrichment analysis
   was performed for the three GO domains “cellular component”, “molecular
   function” and “biological process” as well as for manually curated
   biological pathways (results in [94]Table 1). To allow graphical
   representation of the results, it was then calculated what percentage
   of the proteins representing each enriched GO term or biological
   pathway was unchanged, significantly up-regulated or significantly
   down-regulated in the CSE-EVs. Proteins of the cellular component
   “exosomes” showed a similar percentage of unchanged, up-regulated and
   down-regulated proteins as the total protein set ([95]Figure 5(b),
   [96]Table 1). Upon CSE exposure there was an up-regulation of proteins
   associated with the “plasma membrane” and the “cell surface”
   ([97]Figure 5(b), [98]Table 1). Concerning the molecular function,
   proteins representing “extracellular matrix structural constituent”,
   “ubiquitin-specific protease activity” and “chaperone activity” were
   mostly unchanged, whereas there was a clear up-regulation of proteins
   with GTPase and receptor activity ([99]Figure 5(c), [100]Table 1).
   Finally, biological process ([101]Figure 5(d), [102]Table 1) and
   biological pathway analyses ([103]Figure 5(e), [104]Table 1) revealed
   that proteins involved in maintenance functions such as “protein
   metabolism”, “cell growth and/or maintenance” and “metabolism of RNA”
   tended to be unchanged or down-regulated. Yet, there was an
   up-regulation of proteins related to immunity (“immune response”,
   “adaptive immune system”) and communication (“cell communication”,
   “signal transduction”; [105]Figure 5(d,e), [106]Table 1). Most
   strikingly, there was a clear up-regulation of proteins involved in
   “haemostasis” and its sub-pathway “platelet activation, signalling and
   aggregation”. [107]Table 2 summarizes all identified proteins of these
   two pathways, including the fold-change, p-value and q-value.

Confirmation of the predicted procoagulant phenotype of CSE-EVs

   The most strongly enriched biological pathway in CSE-EVs was
   “haemostasis”. A prominent member of this pathway is TF, which by
   itself is sufficient to trigger the extrinsic pathway of coagulation.
   In our proteomic data, TF was 1.4-fold up-regulated in CSE-EVs
   (p = 0.03, q = 0.05, [111]Table 2). To verify whether TF was indeed
   associated with the isolated EVs and not a co-isolated contaminant, we
   determined the presence of TF on tetraspanin-positive EVs using
   bead-based flow cytometry on conditioned cell culture media, and on a
   standardized number of isolated EVs (10^8 particles/ml). For cell
   culture media, we assessed the presence of TF on EVs captured using
   beads that were coated with antibodies against either a combination of
   tetraspanins (CD63, CD81, CD9), or each individual tetraspanin. For all
   bead types, we confirmed the presence of TF on control-EVs and CSE-EVs.
   Moreover, there was a statistically significant increase in TF^+ EVs
   using all bead types for the CSE-exposed condition ([112]Figure 6(a)).
   This was also the case when TF was measured for a standardized
   concentration of isolated EVs (10^8 particles/ml) using CD63/CD81/CD9
   beads ([113]Figure 6(b)). The increased TF expression on EVs was
   associated with increased TF activity as assessed by a factor Xa
   generation assay ([114]Figure 6(c)). The control conditions, namely the
   protein-rich EV-low SEC fractions (fractions 14–19) and unconditioned
   media isolates (UCM, corresponding to the EV-rich SEC fractions but
   obtained from media that have not been in contact with cells) had
   little and no detectable TF activity, respectively. The EV-secreting
   cells also showed an up-regulation of cell surface exposed TF when
   exposed to CSE, similar to the increase observed on CSE-EVs
   ([115]Figure 6(d)).

   cytometry with anti-CD63/CD81/CD9-coated beads, n = 9. (g) Thrombin

   presence of the PS blocker annexin V; n = 4. (h) PS externalization on

   using annexin V and PI staining; n = 6. *p < 0.05; AnxV: annexin V;

   iodide; PS: phosphatidylserine; RFU: relative fluorescent units; TF:
   tissue factor; TRPS: tuneable resistive pulse sensing; UCM:
   unconditioned medium isolate.

   Next, isolated EVs were added to normal human plasma and thrombin
   generation was assessed over time. As predicted, CSE-EVs induced more
   thrombin generation than control-EVs for a standardized number of EVs
   (10^8 particles, [117]Figure 7(a)). When CSE-EVs were used at the
   double concentration in line with the approximately two-fold EV
   induction by CSE, this effect was further enhanced ([118]Figure 7(a)).
   Neither the protein-rich SEC fractions, nor unconditioned media
   isolates were able to trigger thrombin generation, suggesting that this
   effect can be attributed specifically to the EVs ([119]Figure 7(a)).
   Finally, thrombin generation was partly inhibited by addition of ASIS,
   which traps TF in an inactive complex and thereby inhibits the
   extrinsic pathway ([120]Figure 7(b)). Thus, TF partly accounts for the
   procoagulant effect of CSE-EVs, but other factors are likely to
   contribute as well.

   smoke extract; EV: extracellular vesicles; UCM: unconditioned medium
   isolate.

   Besides TF, the phospholipid PS is known to contribute to the
   procoagulant effects of EVs [[122]22]. Therefore, we assessed whether
   the remaining difference in procoagulant potential between CSE-EVs and
   control-EVs during TF-pathway inhibition could be due to increased
   surface-exposed PS on CSE-EVs. Bead-based flow cytometry of conditioned
   media revealed that PS was increased on EVs captured by beads coated
   with a cocktail of antibodies against CD63, CD81 and CD9 or against
   each individual protein ([123]Figure 6(e)). This was not purely due to
   increased EV release, as there was also increased PS signal for a
   standardized concentration of isolated CSE-EVs compared to control-EVs
   ([124]Figure 6(f)). Additionally, PS-dependent thrombin generation was
   assessed by prothrombinase assay. For a standardized EV particle
   number, CSE-EVs resulted in significantly more thrombin generation than
   control-EVs, confirming their enrichment in PS. The difference between
   CSE-EVs and control-EVs could be attributed to PS, as PS blockage with
   annexin V substantially decreased the thrombin generation and equalized
   the effect of CSE-EVs and control-EVs ([125]Figure 6(g)). By flow
   cytometry, we showed that the increased PS exposure of CSE-EVs was not
   paralleled by PS externalization of the secreting cells, as there was
   no increase in PS^+ cells upon CSE exposure ([126]Figure 6(h)).
   Finally, it was assessed to what extent PS accounts for EV-induced
   thrombin generation in normal human plasma. Annexin V treatment of EVs
   completely abolished thrombin induction by control-EVs and strongly
   decreased the thrombin generation by CSE-EVs ([127]Figure 7(c)). When
   EVs were treated with Annexin-V and the TF inhibitor ASIS was added,
   thrombin generation was completely prevented for both control-EVs and
   CSE-EVs ([128]Figure 7(d)). Thus, TF and PS together appear to account
   for a large proportion of thrombin generation in normal human plasma in
   response to control-EVs and CSE-induced EVs.

Discussion

   The airway epithelium is constantly exposed to inhaled air, and
   airborne exposures modulate the behaviour of airway epithelial cells.
   We and others have recently shown that exposure to CSE stimulates
   airway epithelial cells to release EVs [[129]2,[130]5]. Here we extend
   this finding and present to our knowledge the first study which
   characterizes the proteomic composition of CSE-induced EVs and its
   functional implications. Using nano-LC-MS/MS, we demonstrated that
   CSE-EVs show a notable up-regulation of proteins involved in the
   pathway “haemostasis”, i.e. in stopping bleeding. One of these proteins
   was TF, and we confirmed a partly TF-dependent procoagulant effect for
   the CSE-EVs in vitro.

   While no unique proteins were identified in either control-EVs or
   CSE-EVs, 33% of the proteins were differentially expressed between the
   two conditions. Functional enrichment analysis of the EV proteome for
   GO terms of the “cellular component” GO domain showed that the
   CSE-exposure caused an up-regulation of proteins of the “plasma
   membrane” and “cell surface”. This might imply that CSE exposure
   results in a shift from the release of endosomal-derived exosomes to
   plasma membrane-derived microvesicles. Alternatively, there may have
   been a specific sorting of cell surface proteins into the EVs rather
   than a shift in EV type. This is supported by the fact that the size
   distribution of control-EVs and CSE-EVs was similar, whereas a shift
   towards microvesicle release would most likely be associated with an
   increase in the EV diameter. Concerning the GO domain “molecular
   function”, CSE-EVs were enriched in proteins with “GTPase activity” and
   “receptor activity”, in line with an involvement in cell signalling.
   Congruently, there was an up-regulation of the biological processes
   “immune response”, “cell communication” and “signal transduction”.
   While we have not performed a functional evaluation of these enriched
   biological processes, others have previously proposed an involvement of
   CSE-induced airway epithelial-derived EVs in cell-to-cell
   communication. In particular, cells that were stimulated with CSE-EVs
   were shown to undergo pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic changes
   [[131]2,[132]23].

   Functional enrichment analysis for manually curated biological pathways
   revealed that “haemostasis” and “platelet activation, signalling and
   aggregation” were strikingly up-regulated in the CSE-induced EVs,
   suggesting an involvement in thrombus formation. When added to human
   plasma, CSE-EVs caused faster and more thrombin generation than
   control-EVs, confirming enrichment in procoagulant factors. This effect
   could be partly attributed to EV-associated TF and to the procoagulant
   phospholipid PS. Concomitant inhibition of both, TF and PS, completely
   abolished CSE-EV-induced thrombin generation.

   It is well known that smokers have an elevated risk of thrombotic
   cardiovascular diseases [[133]24] and that circulating EVs can
   contribute to hypercoagulability and thrombotic disease via expression
   of TF and PS [[134]25]. Moreover, it has previously been shown that CSE
   can induce release of TF^+ procoagulant EVs from monocytes and
   macrophages [[135]3,[136]10]. Our study adds that also airway
   epithelial cells respond to CSE by releasing TF^+ procoagulant EVs and
   that, besides TF^+, a number of other EV-associated prothrombotic
   proteins are up-regulated upon CSE exposure. Moreover, while EV-borne
   procoagulant activity is classically considered to be associated with
   microvesicles [[137]25], the procoagulant EVs in this study are small
   and enriched in tetraspanins, which suggests that they may be exosomes.
   This would imply that either functions of exosomes and microvesicles
   overlap or the EV populations as such overlap. A side-by-side
   evaluation of the exosome (small EV)- and microvesicle (larger
   EV)-associated TF release of CSE stimulated cells could help elucidate
   this issue.

   One question that remains unanswered here is whether airway
   epithelial-derived procoagulant EVs actually enter the blood
   circulation and thus contribute to hypercoagulability in smokers.
   Although this seems plausible because smoking impairs the function of
   the epithelial–endothelial barrier in the lungs [[138]26,[139]27],
   there are still no clear data on the effect smoking on circulating TF^+
   EVs. While Baek et al. found an increase in TF^+ (referred to as CD142)
   EVs in female smokers compared to non-smokers [[140]28], Badrnya et al.
   did not detect any significant changes in circulating TF^+ EVs between
   young healthy smokers and non-smokers [[141]29]. Yet, TF^+ EVs may also
   have local effects in the lungs. Intriguingly, elevated concentrations
   of TF^+ EVs have been detected in the lungs of patients with several
   lung diseases, including asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome
   (ARDS) and interstitial lung disease [[142]30–[143]34]. Moreover, TF is
   secreted by airway and alveolar epithelial cells in an EV-associated
   form in response to mechanical stress, pro-inflammatory mediators or
   oxidants [[144]30–[145]32]. Besides its prominent role in coagulation,
   TF also exerts alternative functions, such as regulating inflammatory
   responses and promoting angiogenesis and wound repair
   [[146]35–[147]39]. To date, these alternative functions are relatively
   poorly explored. It is thus promising to investigate whether TF^+ EVs
   contribute to tissue remodelling in chronic lung diseases. Importantly,
   there is a high rate of comorbidity of the smoking-associated chronic
   lung disease COPD and cardiovascular disease [[148]40]. In vivo and
   clinical studies are warranted to investigate whether this can be
   explained by an increased production of TF^+ EVs in response to
   cigarette smoking.

   In conclusion, CSE-induced EVs from airway epithelial cells are – among
   others – enriched in proteins that are involved in cell communication,
   the immune response and haemostasis compared to control-EVs. An
   enhanced procoagulant effect of CSE-induced EVs was confirmed in vitro
   and shown to depend largely on EV-associated TF and PS. Increased
   production of procoagulant EVs in response to airway epithelial cell
   stress could be a mechanistic explanation for the high degree of
   comorbidity between chronic lung diseases and cardiovascular diseases.
