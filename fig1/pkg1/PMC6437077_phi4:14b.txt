Here's how you can extract and organize the relevant information from the scientific article regarding the pathway enrichment analysis:

1. **Tool Used for Pathway Enrichment Analysis:**
   - The tool used was DAVID.

2. **Tool Version Number:**
   - Not described (no version number provided).

3. **Gene Set Library Queried:**
   - GO and KEGG pathways were queried using the DAVID web server.

4. **Background Gene List Defined:**
   - Not described (the article does not specify if a background gene list was defined).

5. **Statistical Test Used for Enrichment Analysis:**
   - Not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but generally, DAVID uses enrichment scores and p-values as part of its analysis.

6. **False Discovery Rate Correction:**
   - Not described (no mention of false discovery rate correction methods like Benjamini-Hochberg).

Here's how you can organize this information into a table format:

| Question | Answer                        |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Tool Used for Pathway Enrichment Analysis | DAVID                         |
| Tool Version Number           | Not described                 |
| Gene Set Library Queried      | GO and KEGG                   |
| Background Gene List Defined  | Not described                 |
| Statistical Test Used         | Not explicitly mentioned      |
| FDR Correction Used           | Not described                 |
