To extract information on pathway enrichment analysis from the provided scientific article, let's analyze the content based on your instructions:

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - The article does not describe any specific tool used explicitly for pathway enrichment analysis.

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**
   - Since no tool is mentioned, there is no version number provided.

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**
   - The article mentions the Gene Ontology (GO) in the context of functional categories and biological processes, indicating that GO analysis was performed.

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - The article does not explicitly state whether a specific background gene list was defined for pathway enrichment analysis.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**
   - No specific statistical tests are described in the context of pathway enrichment analysis within the article.

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - The article does not mention the use of any false discovery rate (FDR) correction methods for controlling false positives.
