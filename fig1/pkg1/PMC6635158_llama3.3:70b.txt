Here are the answers to the questions:

1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?
The article does not explicitly mention a specific tool used for pathway enrichment analysis, but it mentions that KEGG pathway analysis was performed, suggesting that a tool or software that can perform KEGG pathway analysis was used.

2. Was a tool version number provided?
Not described.

3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?
KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis was performed.

4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described.

5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?
Not described.

6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described.

Note that the article does not provide detailed information about the methodology used for pathway enrichment analysis, so most of the answers are "not described".
