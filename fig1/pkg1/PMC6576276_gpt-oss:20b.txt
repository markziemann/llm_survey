Thinking...
We need to answer six questions. We have article abstract but not full methods. Need to locate Methods section details. Since only abstract provided, but maybe the article includes details in the full text. But we need to extract only what is explicitly reported. If not present, write "Not described".

Given only abstract, we cannot determine pathway enrichment analysis details beyond what is mentioned: "Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was applied to recognise gene pathways associated with vitamin A supplementation." That is the only enrichment tool explicitly mentioned. The question: "What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?: List all tools or software packages used (e.g., DAVID, GSEA, Enrichr, etc.) that are explicitly mentioned in the article for enrichment analysis. Do not include tools used only for preprocessing (e.g., Salmon)." So we list "Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)".

"Was enrichment tool version(s) described?" Not in abstract. Likely not. So "Not described".

"Which gene set libraries were used?" They used IPA canonical pathways. So gene set library: "Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base" or "canonical pathways". Might need to list. Only if stated. In abstract: "Genes relating to Rho-GTPases and regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, such as CDC42 and FLNA, persisted among canonical pathways (P < 0.05)." So the library is canonical pathways of IPA. So we list "Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base canonical pathways". Might not mention others.

"Does the article describe using a custom or specific background gene list for enrichment analysis?" Not mentioned. So "Not described".

"What statistical test(s) were used in enrichment analysis?" Not mentioned. So "Not described".

"Was multiple testing correction / FDR applied to enrichment analysis?" Not mentioned. So "Not described".

We need to provide output in table format. Likely columns: Question, Answer.

Let's format as table with headings: Category, Detail.

Let's answer accordingly.

Also note: There might be mention of Genespring for differential expression, but not enrichment. Genespring might be used for enrichment? Genespring has enrichment features but not mentioned. So only IPA.

Thus final answer.
...done thinking.
