Thinking...
We need to answer 6 questions based on the article.

The question: "What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? List all tools or software packages used (e.g., DAVID, GSEA, Enrichr, etc.) that are explicitly mentioned in the article for enrichment analysis. Do not include tools used only for preprocessing (e.g., Salmon)."

From Methods: They used DAVID bioinformatics resources. They also mention GO term analysis (maybe using DAVID). They mention STRING website for interaction network but not for enrichment. They mention DAVID for functional classification and GO term analysis. They mention "DAVID bioinformatics resources" in Methods. So tool: DAVID. Not mention GSEA, etc. So only DAVID.

Were enrichment tool version(s) described?: They did not specify version. So "Not described".

Which gene set libraries were used?: They mention GO terms, UniProtKB Keywords, and they used DAVID to analyze functional classification. They mention GO term analysis. So libraries: GO (Gene Ontology). They didn't mention KEGG, Reactome. So only GO. Also mention "UniProtKB Keywords original database". They used DAVID to classify proteins into functional categories using UniProtKB Keywords. So gene set libraries: GO, UniProtKB Keywords. They mention "Gene Ontology categories" (cellular component, molecular function, biological process). So GO categories are used. They didn't mention KEGG, Reactome. So gene set libraries: GO, UniProtKB Keywords.

Does article describe using a custom or specific background gene list? Not described.

What statistical test(s) used in enrichment analysis? They used DAVID. Usually hypergeometric test. But not explicitly. Let's check article. They didn't state statistical tests. They didn't mention hypergeometric or Fisher's exact. So "Not described".

Was multiple testing correction / FDR applied? They didn't mention. So "Not described".

Now produce table with columns: Tool, Version, Gene set libraries, Custom background, Statistical test, Multiple testing correction.

We need to list each tool separately. There's only DAVID. So row for DAVID.

We must include all details reported. For other fields if not described, put "Not described".

Let's craft the table.

...done thinking.
