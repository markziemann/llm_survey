Abstract

   Firefighters are exposed to carcinogens and have elevated cancer rates.
   We hypothesized that occupational exposures in firefighters would lead
   to DNA methylation changes associated with activation of cancer
   pathways and increased cancer risk. To address this hypothesis, we
   collected peripheral blood samples from 45 incumbent and 41 new recruit
   non-smoking male firefighters and analyzed the samples for DNA
   methylation using an Illumina Methylation EPIC 850k chip. Adjusting for
   age and ethnicity, we performed: 1) genome-wide differential
   methylation analysis; 2) genome-wide prediction for firefighter status
   (incumbent or new recruit) and years of service; and 3) Ingenuity
   Pathway Analysis (IPA). Four CpGs, including three in the YIPF6, MPST,
   and PCED1B genes, demonstrated above 1.5-fold statistically significant
   differential methylation after Bonferroni correction. Genome-wide
   methylation predicted with high accuracy incumbent and new recruit
   status as well as years of service among incumbent firefighters. Using
   IPA, the top pathways with more than 5 gene members annotated from
   differentially methylated probes included Sirtuin signaling pathway,
   p53 signaling, and 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.
   These DNA methylation findings suggest potential cellular mechanisms
   associated with increased cancer risk in firefighters.

Introduction

   Epidemiologic studies of firefighters from multiple countries have
   demonstrated an elevated rate of cancer incidence and/or mortality for
   a number of cancer types [[51]1–[52]8]. For example, in a recent study
   of three large fire departments in the United States, overall cancer
   incidence and mortality was significantly increased by 9% and 14%,
   respectively, as compared with the general population, and significant
   increases in cancer incidence and mortality were noted specifically for
   cancers of the esophagus, intestine, lung, and kidney [[53]2].
   Firefighters are occupationally exposed to multiple products of
   combustion and other substances containing carcinogens through
   inhalation and/or skin contamination [[54]9–[55]11], including but not
   limited to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzene, per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and diesel exhaust [[56]11–[57]15].
   However, other risk factors such as shift work may also contribute to
   this elevated cancer risk [[58]16].

   Epigenetic modifications are critical steps in carcinogenesis and
   cancer prevention [[59]17, [60]18]. We have previously shown that
   microRNAs are differentially expressed between incumbent and new
   recruit firefighters [[61]19], but published information on DNA
   methylation in firefighters to our knowledge has been limited to four
   genes [[62]20]. DNA methylation refers to the addition of a methyl
   group to cytosine within 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpG) dinucleotides, which
   are often concentrated in large clusters called CpG islands.
   Inactivation of certain tumor-suppressor genes occurs as a consequence
   of hypermethylation within the promoter regions and numerous studies
   have demonstrated a broad range of genes silenced by DNA methylation in
   different cancer types [[63]21–[64]24]. Global hypomethylation,
   inducing genomic instability, also contributes to cell transformation.
   Apart from DNA methylation alterations in promoter regions and
   repetitive DNA sequences, this phenomenon is associated with regulation
   of expression of noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs that may play a role
   in tumor suppression. Furthermore, DNA methylation has shown promise in
   putative translational use in patients and hypermethylated promoters
   may serve as disease-related biomarkers [[65]25, [66]26]. Importantly,
   while every effort is made by previous studies to put identified
   methylation signatures in context, it should be noted that the
   landscape of methylation alterations and the associated impact on gene
   activity is extremely complex. Thus, changes in methylation signatures
   are not always clearly linked to specific alterations in gene activity.

   We hypothesized that compared to new recruits without previous
   firefighting experience, incumbent firefighters would show differential
   DNA methylation patterns that had been previously associated with
   cancer. We analyzed DNA methylation in peripheral blood by microarray
   and compared the results between new recruits and incumbent
   firefighters to address this hypothesis.

Methods

Subjects

   Study protocols were approved by the University of Arizona
   Institutional Review Board (approval No.1509137073) and all subjects
   provided written informed consent. The study subjects were selected
   from a larger group of incumbent firefighters within the Tucson Fire
   Department (Tucson, Arizona, United States of America) and new recruit
   firefighters prior to any live-fire exposures or other occupational
   exposures to fire and smoke. All subjects completed questionnaires
   regarding their age, body weight, height, working duration as
   firefighters, and tobacco use.

   Initially, blood for methylation analysis was collected from 47 male
   incumbents and 48 male and one female new recruits. Subjects who either
   had current smoking exposure or missing smoking information and the
   sole female recruit were excluded, leaving 86 (45 incumbents and 41
   recruits) subjects for methylation data analysis. Body mass index (BMI)
   (kg/m^2) was classified as normal (18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9),
   and obese (≥ 30) following World Health Organization (WHO)
   classifications.

DNA methylation measurement

   Blood samples were collected in one 6.0 ml dipotassium
   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K[2]EDTA) tube (Becton, Dickinson and
   Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) for DNA methylation analyses. As an
   alternative to the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tube, eight
   samples were also collected in cell preparation tubes (CPTs) (Becton,
   Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The EDTA tube was processed
   within 30 minutes of collection, which consisted of centrifugation at
   3200 rpm for 15 minutes and separation of the plasma from the cells.
   All aliquots were stored at -20 °C until transfer under Arizona
   Department of Transportation guidelines to the University of Arizona
   for storage at -80 °C for subsequent processing by the University of
   Arizona Genetics Core. The CPT was processed according to the product
   guidelines and the cell pellet was stored at -80 °C until processed.

   Genomic DNA from the EDTA tubes and CPTs was isolated using the
   FlexiGene DNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Genomic DNA was extracted
   from 9 additional packed cell pellets from CPTs using the Qiagen DNeasy
   Blood and Tissue Kit. DNA quantity was assessed with the QuantiFluor
   dsDNA System (Promega, Madison, WI) on the Synergy HT plate reader
   (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT) and 96 of the highest yield
   samples were normalized to 250ng in 30uL. The samples then underwent
   bisulfite conversion using the Zymo EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo
   Research Corp., Irvine, CA) with a genomic DNA input of 250ng. The
   recommended modification to the protocol using alternative incubation
   conditions for the Illumina assays was performed. Upon bisulfite
   conversion completion, samples were sent to the University of Utah DNA
   Sequencing and Genomics Core Facility (Salt Lake City, Utah) for
   Infinium HD Methylation using the Illumina MethylationEPIC kit
   (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) scanning on the iScan instrument, and
   raw data export.

   Raw intensity data were processed by Bioconductor package minfi
   (version 1.22.1) [[67]27] which included normalization of data using
   Illumina’s reference factor-based normalization methods (preprocess
   Illumina) and Subset-quantile Within-Array Normalisation (SWAN)
   [[68]28] for type I and II probe bias correction. All samples passed
   quality control. A detection p-value is returned for every genomic
   position in every sample, with small p-values indicating good quality
   probes. Probes with detection p-value > 0.05 in one or more samples,
   and probes with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) inside their
   body or at the nucleotide extension were excluded, leaving 834,912
   probes. DNA methylation levels (M-values) were determined by
   calculating the logarithm of the ratio of intensities between
   methylated (signal A) and unmethylated (signal B) alleles, log (A/B)
   [[69]28, [70]29]. Potential batch effects were investigated using
   principal component analysis using M-values.

Statistical analyses

Differential methylation analysis

   Differentially methylated probes were detected using the limma package
   [[71]30]. A linear model with Empirical Bayes estimator was adopted
   [[72]31], with adjustment for age, ethnicity, and BMI. Probes were
   considered to be differentially methylated if the resulting adjusted
   p-value was <0.05. The Bonferroni correction method was used to adjust
   the p-values and ensure that the familywise error rate was less than
   0.05 [[73]32]. The DMRcate package was used to identify differentially
   methylated regions (DMR) based on tunable kernel smoothing of the
   differential methylation signal, adopting the default setting [[74]33].
   DMRcate uses limma-derived statistics for calculation of individual CpG
   site methylation differences and it can assess all 850K probes as
   candidates for DMR constituents. The corresponding gene list was
   derived from the gene annotations associated with the probes. Because
   our DNA samples were derived from blood, we estimated white blood cell
   type composition for every individual using the Houseman method
   [[75]34]. We corrected the analysis by including the estimated cell
   type composition as covariates in the linear model. Only results that
   were significant first without and then also with adjustment for cell
   type composition were reported as it has been shown that when cell
   composition and age are confounded, adjustment of cell-type composition
   can lead to false positives [[76]35].

Genome-wide methylation prediction

   Genome-wide methylation prediction was performed with the glmnet
   package using elastic-net penalization [[77]36]. Years of service
   information was collected for both incumbent and new recruit
   firefighters. Since the newly recruited firefighters’ years of service
   measures were zero, we carried out a two-stage prediction model to
   incorporate this excess of zeros in the distribution of years of
   service. In the first stage we used genome wide methylation profile,
   age, BMI, and ethnicity to predict job status, i.e., recruit vs
   incumbent firefighter, which is equivalent to exposed to fire or not.
   In the second stage, for firefighters predicted to be incumbents, we
   then predicted their years of service. We employed a 10-fold cross
   validation strategy to repeatedly perform trainings on 90% of our
   sample set while holding out 10% of the samples for a test set. This
   procedure was repeated 10 times on unique subgroups of the entire data
   set.

Pathway analysis

   We performed pathway analysis for the top probes differentially
   methylated between new recruits and incumbent firefighters using a p
   value of < 10^−4 selected based on the published literature [[78]37],
   and an empirically selected 1.5-fold change between the two groups.
   These probes were annotated to genes according to the closest
   transcription start site (TSS) [[79]38]. The gene list was uploaded to
   QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN Redwood City) for
   assessing overrepresentation relative to all human gene functions
   [[80]39]. The Pathway Build and Relationship Summary tools in IPA were
   used to build the gene regulatory networks, including expression
   regulation, protein-protein/DNA interaction, activation and inhibition.
   Genes were ranked by their connectivity in the regulatory networks, and
   genes with the top 10% connectivity were chosen as hubs. Hub genes play
   important roles in gene regulation due to their multiple interactions
   with other genes [[81]40]. Two analyses were then performed to reveal
   the related canonical pathways and human diseases. First, using the
   Canonical Pathways tool, we identified canonical signaling (or
   metabolic) pathways with associated input genes and ranked the pathways
   by the number of gene members. Pathways that included more than five
   gene members were defined as top canonical pathways in this regulatory
   network. Second, using the IPA scientific literature-based Diseases and
   Functions overlay tool we annotated the genes enriched within human
   diseases and biological functions. The software is backed by highly
   structured, detail-rich biological and chemical findings derived from
   top journals and reviewed using full text and is also supported by
   third-party information, including but not limited to GO, TarBase,
   ClinicalTrials.gov, and BIND. It retrieves a wealth of experimental
   evidence for genes and explores the association with diseases or
   phenotypes by leveraging the depth of the Ingenuity Ontology and the
   Human Phenotype Ontology. With the IPA application, the significance of
   each enriched disease module is calculated as follows: (1) the number
   of input genes mapped to a given disease module in the IPA literature
   database, denoted by m; (2) the number of genes included in the disease
   module, denoted by M; (3) the total number of input genes mapped to the
   IPA’s literature database, denoted by n; and (4) the total number of
   known genes included in the IPA’s literature database denoted by N. The
   significance of gene enrichment in the disease module is then
   calculated using a one-tailed Fisher’s exact test [[82]41]. Genes with
   no regulatory relationship with any other genes were excluded from
   analysis.

   As IPA does not take the direction of the effects into consideration,
   directionality of methylation alteration was not assessed separately.
   Instead all alterations (whether gain of methylation or loss of
   methylation) were included in the analysis. The rational for this
   approach is that the methylation signature and associated alterations
   are a reflection of a cell’s transcriptional activity. Thus, regardless
   of direction, all methylation states in our samples of interest in
   theory contribute to the activity of cellular pathways.

Results

Subjects

   All subjects were white, and a similar percentage of incumbent and new
   recruit firefighters were of Hispanic ethnicity ([83]Table 1). The
   subjects’ mean age in years was significantly higher in incumbents
   (40.6 ± 7.7) than in recruits (28.9 ± 6.3) (p<0.001). The incumbent
   firefighters and recruits had similar distribution of BMI. For
   incumbents, the mean number of years serving as a firefighter was 14.0
   ± 7.2 years, and number of years of service was significantly
   correlated with age (Pearson’s r = 0.804, p<0.0001). Distribution of
   cell type composition across job status is shown in [84]Fig 1. There
   were no significant differences comparing the incumbent and new recruit
   firefighters.

Differential methylation analysis

   Comparing incumbents to recruits and adjusting for multiple
   comparisons, age, BMI, and ethnicity, as well as cell type composition,
   four CpGs (cg00287370, cg05236728, cg12253469 and cg24034992)
   demonstrated statistically significant differential methylation
   exceeding 1.5-fold ([88]Table 2). These four CpGs included one that was
   hypermethylated and three that were hypomethylated in incumbent
   firefighters compared to new recruits. Two of the three hypomethylated
   CpGs were annotated to promoter regions. One additional CpG
   (cg07897354) demonstrated significantly reduced methylation in
   incumbents as compared with recruits when adjusting for multiple
   comparisons, age and ethnicity, but lost significance when BMI was
   added to the model. In order to further assess the effects of age on
   differential methylation between incumbent and new recruit
   firefighters, we also investigated whether any of the CpG sites in
   [89]Table 2 varied significantly by age group (<40 years old vs > 40
   years old). None of these sites was significantly associated with age
   after correction for multiple comparisons (data not shown). In a
   separate analysis, 41 differentially methylated regions were
   identified, of which seven were still significant after adjustment for
   cell type compositions ([90]Table 3).

Genome-wide methylation prediction

   Using a 10-fold cross validation procedure, we applied machine learning
   algorithms to determine which CpGs had variable methylation associated
   with firefighters’ service status, i.e., new recruit or incumbent, and
   the years of service each individual had performed. In each stage of
   cross validation, the CpGs that were determined by the training to be
   predictive were noted. A total of 91 CpGs were selected at least once
   during the 10 rounds of training associated with firefighters’ years of
   service. However, only 11 CpGs (cg09544149, cg24034992, cg22280238,
   cg00287370, cg02932780, cg13753209, cg15304928, cg07897354, cg22433210,
   cg20821958, and cg03177084) were selected in more than half of the
   trainings. The best-performing model was chosen based on the lowest
   misclassification rate in the first stage and the lowest mean squared
   error of years of service in the second stage in the test set. This
   model was then applied to the entire data set and predictions were
   compared to the actual years of service ([98]Fig 2). The resulting
   misclassification rate between predicted incumbents and actual
   incumbent firefighters was 2% in the first stage and within incumbent
   firefighters the correlation of predicted and actual years of service
   was robust with an R^2 of 0.889. We also evaluated whether including
   DNA methylation could increase predictive power compared to only using
   the covariates age, BMI, and ethnicity. By adding methylation levels to
   the prediction model, r^2 increased from 0.533 to 0.889 and the
   misclassification rate was reduced from 8% to 2% (data not shown).

Pathway analysis

   Five hundred and twelve CpG sites demonstrated differential methylation
   with a p-value < 10^−4 and at least 1.5-fold differences between
   incumbent firefighters and new recruits. They were annotated to 443
   unique genes which were used to build a gene regulatory network
   ([101]Fig 3). There were 93 genes that had at least one connection with
   other genes in the regulatory network. All hub genes had at least 20
   connected relationships. They included STAT3, TP63, TP73, FOXO1, PML,
   DAXX, RUNX2, INSR, and PCNA. Top pathways with more than 5 gene members
   annotated from differentially methylated probes included the Sirtuin
   signaling pathway (3 hubs of 8 gene members: FOXO1, STAT3 and TP73),
   molecular mechanisms of cancer (2 hubs of 7 gene members: DAXX and
   FOXO1), p53 signaling (4 hubs of 7 gene members: PCNA, PML, TP63 and
   TP73), and 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling (2 hubs of
   6 gene members: FOXO1 and INSR). Enriched diseases (disease annotation)
   included abdominal cancer (9 hubs of 88 genes), colon tumor (8 hubs of
   44 genes), skin cancer (6 hubs of 51 genes), and lung tumor/cancer (5
   hubs of 49 genes), all with p-values <10^−6 in IPA ([102]Table 4). To
   address the effect of using a different fold change criteria, we
   performed a sensitivity analysis by using the same p-value < 10^−4 but
   with a two-fold change limit (data not shown). The sensitivity analysis
   identified 293 CpG sites annotated to 282 unique genes (reduced from
   512 CpG sites annotated to 443 genes in the primary analysis). Among
   them, 67 genes had at least one connection with other genes in the
   regulatory network based on IPA databases. Using the same hub gene
   criterion as in the primary analysis (i.e., with >20 connections with
   other genes in the regulatory network), six hub genes were identified,
   including STAT3, PML, RUNX2, DAXX, PCNA, and INSR. All of them were
   also reported in the primary analysis. The Sirtuin signaling pathway
   remained the top pathway with 5 annotated gene members, and the
   molecular mechanisms of cancer, p53 signaling, and AMPK signaling
   pathways all had at least 3 gene members.

Discussion

   The results of this study support our hypothesis that, compared to new
   recruits, incumbent firefighters would show differential DNA
   methylation associated with cancer pathways. This adds to the currently
   sparse body of literature describing the epigenetic effects among
   firefighters, a population occupationally exposed to known carcinogens
   with documented increased cancer risk [[106]2].

   Our differential methylation analysis identified five CpGs assigned to
   both promoter and non-promoter regions. Promoter hypermethylation
   frequently leads to silencing of tumor-suppressor or DNA repair genes
   in cancers while hypomethylation of CpGs often results in
   overexpression of genes [[107]22, [108]42–[109]44]. However, recent
   investigations of broader methylation patterns suggest that
   non-promoter (intragenic) methylation may also affect transcription
   regulation and efficiency; while CpG hypermethylation in non-promoter
   regions does not impede transcription (as it does in promoter regions),
   it has been correlated with increased or ectopic gene expression
   [[110]45–[111]48].

   Four of the five differentially expressed CpG sites are located in
   genes with known functions and reported associations with cancer and
   metastatic potential. However, all five differentially expressed CpGs
   identified in this study represent novel epigenetic markers that have
   not previously been reported in the limited body of literature
   describing differential DNA methylation in firefighters or those with
   similar occupational exposures. One CpG with decreased methylation
   among incumbent firefighters was located on the YIPF6 gene, annotated
   to the promoter region. YIPF6 has been associated with prostate cancer,
   and amplification and overexpression of YIPF6 protein has been posited
   to indirectly stimulate tumor progression [[112]49, [113]50]. Another
   CpG with decreased methylation in incumbent firefighters is located in
   the gene body of PCED1B. This gene encodes a protein that belongs to
   the GDSL/SGNH-like acyl-esterase family, hydrolases thought to function
   in modification of biopolymers on the cell surface. High expression of
   this gene has significant associations with renal (unfavorable) and
   urothelial cancer (favorable) patient survival based on Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) data
   ([114]https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000179715-PCED1B/pathology).
   One CpG with decreased methylation in incumbent firefighters, that was
   statistically significant until additionally adjusted for BMI
   ([115]Table 2), is located in the promoter region of SPIRE1. The
   dysregulated expression of the protein encoded by this gene, SPIRE1,
   has been associated with cellular potential for extracellular matrix
   degradation, which may impact the invasive and metastatic behavior of
   cancer cells [[116]51]. The hypermethylated CpG identified in our
   analysis was located on the MPST gene body. The MPST encoded protein is
   associated with cysteine degradation, cyanide detoxification and likely
   other metabolic processes, given observed MPST deficiency in
   individuals with the heritable disorder, mercaptolactate-cysteine
   disulfiduria [[117]52]. As part of its cysteine degradation pathway,
   MPST produces enzymes involved in formation of sulfane sulfur
   containing compounds. Sulfur metabolism dysregulation in cancer cells
   and anti-cancer effects in vivo of sulfane sulfur precursors suggest
   that proliferation of malignant cells may be related to a deficiency of
   sulfane sulfur and the uncontrolled operation of a set of enzymes
   normally inactivated by sulfane sulfur [[118]53].

   Of the seven differentially methylated regions that remained
   significant after correction for cell type composition, three were
   located on genes (SYNE2, AR, and PCED1B) with known functions and
   disease associations. SYNE2 encodes a protein involved in maintaining
   the structural integrity of the nucleus. AR, the androgen receptor
   gene, encodes a member of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor family
   that regulates gene expression. AR signaling is reported to be involved
   in prostate, bladder, liver, kidney and lung tumorigenesis and
   metastasis [[119]54, [120]55]. Differential methylation patterns of AR
   are also associated with prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and
   ovarian cancer [[121]24, [122]56–[123]58]. Variants of SYNE2 have been
   associated with p21 expression and reduced overall survival in
   hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma [[124]59]. p21 is a cell
   cycle regulator reported to downregulate TP53, a tumor suppressor
   [[125]60, [126]61]. Known functions of PCED1B, which also contained a
   differentially methylated CpG as shown in [127]Table 2, were previously
   discussed above. Information for the four remaining regions were
   sparse. One region was located on the protein coding gene FAM189A1,
   which is reported to have tissue-specific expression in brain and
   colon, but no known disease associations [[128]62]. No information
   about function or disease associations was found for ZNF528-AS1. One
   region was located on or near uncharacterized genes ([129]AC016582.2
   and CTD-2554C21.2) and for the region containing
   chr19:12,305,392–12,306,303 no further information was available.

   Because DNA methylation signatures are tightly correlated to
   transcriptional activity throughout the genome, they provide a powerful
   platform for prediction of complex traits or diseases
   [[130]63–[131]65]. Our machine learning analyses were used to predict
   whether or not an individual was an incumbent firefighter (and had thus
   had a certain anticipated level of environmental exposures) and how
   long that individual had been in the service. Five of the 11 CpGs
   identified in our best-performing predictive model, cg24034992,
   cg02932780, cg15304928, cg07897354, and cg03177084, were located on or
   near genes YIPF6, VARS, TMEM9, SPIRE1, and PSME3, respectively. YIPF6,
   TMEM9, and PSME3 have been associated with cancer [[132]49, [133]50,
   [134]66–[135]69] and SPIRE1 reportedly contributes to metastatic
   potential [[136]51]. VARS encodes a multi-domain protein that catalyzes
   the aminoacylation of tRNA and has been associated with
   neurodevelopmental disorders [[137]70]. No information was available
   for the remaining 6 CpGs.

   The top identified canonical pathways with differentiated methylated
   genes included many associated with cancer. The sirtuins, which
   regulate a large number of cellular pathways and protect the
   age-associated diseases, regulate processes in cancer cells such as DNA
   repair and cancer metabolism [[138]71, [139]72]. More than half of all
   cancers may involve p53-inactivating mutations, and downstream p53
   signals result in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or senescence
   [[140]72–[141]74]. AMPK, a highly conserved kinase through evolution,
   regulates energy-consuming biosynthetic pathways, and activation of
   AMPK by pharmacological or other means might reduce cancer incidence
   [[142]75, [143]76]. The STAT3 gene, the top identified hub, is a
   component of essential chemical signaling pathways within cells and an
   ideal target for chemoprevention and cancer therapy [[144]77, [145]78].
   STAT3 acetylation silences gene expression and enhances DNA methylation
   of key tumor-suppressor gene promoters, and inhibition of STAT3
   acetylation reverses aberrant CpG island methylation and leads to the
   reactivation of several tumor-suppressing gene promoters [[146]79].
   Overexpression of STAT3 leads to continued growth of tumor cells and
   promotes other malignant properties such as tumor angiogenesis
   [[147]80, [148]81]. Tumor proteins p63 and p73, encoded by the TP63 (on
   p53 pathway) and TP73 genes (on both p53 and Sirtuin pathway), provide
   a complex contribution to tumorigenesis as they regulate cell cycle and
   apoptosis after DNA damage. For example, TP73 has been found to be
   transcriptionally silenced in lymphoblastic leukemias and lymphomas
   induced by CpG island methylation [[149]82–[150]84]. p63 genomic
   amplification may have an early role in lung tumorigenesis and may act
   as a biomarker for lung cancer progression [[151]84]. INSR, has been
   used as a biomarker for prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer and an
   INSR protein inhibitor, Zykadia, has been authorized by U.S. Food and
   Drug Administration (FDA) [[152]85] and European Medicines Agency
   [[153]86] as a treatment of advanced ALK-positive non-small cell lung
   cancer [[154]87].

   Increased risk of many of the enriched diseases identified in our
   pathway analysis (abdominal cancer, adenocarcinoma, colon tumor, skin
   cancer, lung cancer) have been previously reported among firefighters.
   A study examining firefighters from Nordic countries reported excess
   risk of adenocarcinomas among firefighters aged 70 years and older
   [[155]6]. In a pooled cohort of US firefighters, excess cancer
   mortality and incidence were reported for digestive and respiratory
   sites, including colorectal, mesothelioma and lung cancers [[156]2]. A
   higher risk of colorectal cancer was also observed in a 2006
   meta-analysis of 32 studies on firefighters [[157]5]. Several studies
   have also reported higher prevalence and risk of non-melanoma and
   melanoma skin cancer among firefighters [[158]5–[159]7, [160]88].

   Firefighters are exposed to elevated concentrations of multiple
   products of combustion and other toxic substances, including PAHs,
   benzene, and PFAS, many of which are carcinogenic, genotoxic or
   mutagenic [[161]11, [162]13, [163]89–[164]92]. Studies among other
   highly exposed populations have reported associations between PAH
   exposure and global or gene promoter-specific DNA methylation changes,
   suggesting that these epigenetic changes may reflect a history of
   exposure to PAHs [[165]93, [166]94]. Firefighters also generally work
   in shifts, typically 24 hours, and shiftwork that disrupts circadian
   rhythms has been concluded to be “probably carcinogenic” [[167]16].
   Studies in non-firefighter populations have also found that long-term
   shiftwork is associated with differential DNA methylation and
   whole-genome methylation [[168]95, [169]96] and there is increasing
   evidence that long-term shiftwork may increase the risk of breast
   cancer via epigenetic mechanisms [[170]96–[171]98]. Additional studies
   are needed, ideally prospective cohort studies with a larger number of
   firefighters, to help validate the specific CpG sites identified in the
   current study and to determine which exposures are associated with
   altered methylation at those sites.

   Prior published studies on the relationship between firefighter
   occupational exposures and epigenetic changes are scarce. We could find
   only one other study focused on differential DNA methylation among
   firefighters. This study assessed promoter methylation in four a priori
   genes comparing firefighters to non-firefighting controls and reported
   significant decreased methylation for one of the four genes, DUSP22, as
   well as a correlation between duration of firefighting service and
   decreased methylation [[172]20]. However, in our analysis we were
   unable to detect significant differential DNA methylation at the DUSP22
   promoter region. Additionally, the previous study demonstrated that the
   decreased DUSP22 promoter methylation was inducible in cultured human
   cells by low-dose exposure of benzo[a]pyrene, a highly carcinogenic PAH
   [[173]20]. In our previous analysis based on many of the same Arizona
   firefighters evaluated in the current study, we identified nine miRNA
   markers differentially expressed in incumbent firefighters compared to
   new recruits [[174]19]. Notably, the six miRNAs with reduced expression
   in incumbent firefighters have reported tumor suppressor activities
   while two of the three miRNAs with increased expression are reported to
   participate in cancer promoting activities, consistent with the
   hypothesis that firefighters are at increased cancer risk.

   The results of our study provide potential mechanisms linking
   firefighter exposures and the excess risks of specific cancer types
   identified in epidemiologic studies of cancer in the fire service
   [[175]1–[176]8]. Given the long latency between exposures and the
   development of cancer, ranging from less than 5 years to greater than
   30 depending on the type of cancer, DNA methylation biomarkers have the
   potential to be used to both identify the cumulative effect of
   exposures and to identify firefighters at increased risk of disease
   susceptibility. In addition to its use in helping to predict future
   disease, DNA methylation could potentially be used to assist in
   determining cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as has been demonstrated in
   groups other than firefighters [[177]99–[178]101]. For example, the
   methylation signature identified can be used as an “epigenetic clock”
   of firefighting. If the magnitude and/or length of exposures is both
   predictive of cancer risk and detectable in methylation signatures, it
   is likely that prediction of future cancer risk may eventually be
   attainable. If this is true, it is possible that preventative efforts
   and close monitoring can be put in place for firefighters at
   particularly high risk. Identification of epigenetic markers both
   associated with exposures in firefighters and diseases also have the
   potential to assist in determining occupational causation in workers’
   compensation cases.

   Limitations of the current study include a relatively small sample
   size, a cross-sectional design, and inclusion of firefighters from a
   single geographic region. There was also a significant age difference
   between the incumbent and new recruit firefighters, although we
   adjusted for age in our analyses. To further ensure that age
   differences were not driving the differential methylation identified in
   our study, we assessed the CpGs known to be altered with age and
   compared them to the CpGs identified in our study. We did not identify
   any overlap in these significant regions (data not shown). Future
   longitudinal studies of a larger number of firefighters across
   geographic regions are needed to determine the extent to which the
   findings can be generalized to other firefighter populations, ideally
   with an external comparison group of similar age to the incumbent
   firefighters. Information on lifestyle exposures was limited to
   smoking; no information on diet was available, and occupational history
   was limited to years as a firefighter. It will also be important in
   future studies to determine the association among this broader group of
   exposures with the identified DNA methylation markers, as well as to
   determine whether the markers are predictive of disease outcomes in
   firefighters.

Conclusions

   In conclusion, DNA methylation varied among male non-smoking incumbent
   firefighters and new recruits after adjusting for age, BMI and
   ethnicity. Furthermore, DNA methylation markers were also able to
   predict with high accuracy the number of years worked as a firefighter.
   Based on pathway analysis, many of the DNA methylation markers were
   associated with cancer, supporting the potential for these changes to
   help explain the mechanism for increased cancer risk among
   firefighters.
