Thinking...
We need to locate pathway enrichment analysis method details in the article.

Search for "enrichment", "enrichment analysis", "enrich", "tool", "software", "hypergeometric", "Fisher", "FDR", "multiple testing". Look at Methods section.

From the article: In the "Functional enrichment analysis for the EV proteome" results, they talk about "functional enrichment analysis" and "manual curated pathways". In Table (Table 1) they show q-values, fold changes, etc. They mention "the hypergeometric test". Indeed at the end of Table 1 they say: "Displayed are the top 5 GO terms from each of the three GO domains (cellular component, molecular function and biological process). All displayed terms passed the q < 0.05 cut-off (based on a hypergeometric test)." That is explicit: hypergeometric test used.

Also they mention: "The hypergeometric test was performed based on the 'total number of detected proteins' as background (i.e., the total number of proteins that passed the filter and were used for the enrichment analysis) (Table S1)." So they used a custom background list (total detected proteins). So answer Yes.

What tool used? The article may mention "GO terms of the 'cellular component' GO domain". Also "manually curated biological pathways". They may have used the "R package clusterProfiler" or "g:Profiler" etc. Need to look.

Search for tool names. Not visible in the provided excerpt. I didn't see a specific enrichment tool like DAVID, Enrichr, etc. They might have used "Fisher's exact test". But the article says "hypergeometric test". They also mention "FDR correction using Storey-Tibshirani method (q-values)". In Table 1 they show q-values and say "based on a hypergeometric test." At the end of Table 1 they mention "q-values were calculated using the method of Storey & Tibshirani (2003) (as implemented in R package 'qvalue')". Let's check.

Search for "Storey" or "qvalue". Not in the excerpt. Might be in Supplementary Materials. Could be described there.

The excerpt for Table 1 includes a footnote: "q-values were calculated using the method of Storey and Tibshirani (2003) (as implemented in the R package 'qvalue')". Not present in excerpt but we need to check.

Look at the paragraph: "Displayed are the top 5 GO terms from each of the three GO domains (cellular component, molecular function and biological process). All displayed terms passed the q < 0.05 cut-off (based on a hypergeometric test)." They mention q < 0.05 but not the correction method. However, they mention q-values, which are FDR-adjusted p-values. But did they state that they applied multiple testing correction? Yes, q-values are used, so yes.

But we need to know if they describe the method of FDR correction. "Based on a hypergeometric test." But they didn't explicitly mention "Benjamini-Hochberg". However they mention q-values; that implies FDR. The question: "Was multiple testing correction / FDR applied to enrichment analysis?" Only answer Yes if article explicitly mentions FDR, false discovery rate, Benjamini-Hochberg, or a named correction method for the enrichment analysis. So yes, they used q-values (FDR). So answer Yes.

Now, gene set libraries: They used GO terms (cellular component, molecular function, biological process) and manually curated biological pathways (likely "Reactome"? Not described). They mention "manual curated biological pathways" (maybe from "MSigDB" or "KEGG"?). The article explicitly states: "Functional enrichment analysis for manually curated biological pathways revealed that 'haemostasis' and 'platelet activation, signalling and aggregation' were strikingly up-regulated." Not mention of library name. So gene set libraries: GO (Gene Ontology) and "manually curated biological pathways". Could be "Reactome" or "KEGG". Not described. So we list GO (cellular component, molecular function, biological process) and "manually curated pathways". That might be considered a library.

Background gene list: They used "total number of detected proteins" as background. That is described.

Statistical test: hypergeometric test (explicit). Also maybe "Fisher's exact test"? Not described. So hypergeometric test.

Tool used: Not described explicitly. The article does not name a tool (e.g., DAVID, GSEA). They just performed functional enrichment analysis using "hypergeometric test". They might have used R package "clusterProfiler" but not mentioned. So "Not described" for tool.

Version: Not described.

Now compile answers.

We have 6 questions, need to produce table format with columns: Question, Answer (list). Provide separate rows for each tool.

Let's format.

...done thinking.
