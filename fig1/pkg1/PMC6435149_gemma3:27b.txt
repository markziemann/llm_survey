Here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis details based on the provided text, formatted for a table:

| Question                                     | Answer                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | Not described. The article mentions “pathway analysis” but doesn’t specify the tool used. |
| 2. Was a tool version number provided?        | Not described.                                                                                     |
| 3. What gene set library was queried?        | Not described. The article mentions pathways are enriched, but does not specify the library used.   |
| 4. Was a background gene list defined?       | Not described.                                                                                     |
| 5. What statistical test was used?            | Not described.                                                                                     |
| 6. Was false discovery rate correction used? | Yes. The text states “false discovery rate correction was used to control the number of false positives…”. |



**Important Note:** The article is surprisingly sparse on details regarding the *methods* used for pathway enrichment. It *states* that pathway analysis was performed and that FDR correction was applied, but crucial information about the specific tools, parameters, and background gene lists used is absent. This is a limitation of the article in terms of reproducibility and transparency.
