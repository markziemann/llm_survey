Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to answer this user's query about pathway enrichment analysis in a scientific article. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user has provided an abstract and some sections of the article but not the full Methods section. They want to know details about the pathway analysis tools and methods used, such as the tool name, version, gene set libraries queried, background gene list, statistical tests, and FDR correction.

I'll start by reading through the provided text carefully. The abstract mentions things like Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) deposition but doesn't talk about pathway analysis specifically. Looking at the Results section, especially under figures and tables related to pathway enrichment, might give clues, but in this case, the user hasn't provided those.

The Discussion section does talk about various signaling pathways like TGFB and BMP, and how their inhibition affects pluripotency. However, it doesn’t mention the tools or methods used for analyzing these pathways. It's more about the biological implications rather than the computational methods.

I recall that in many scientific articles, especially in biology, pathway enrichment analysis is commonly done using tools like DAVID, GeneSetEnrichmentAnalyzer (GSEA), or maybe even Cytoscape plugins like ClueGO. But without specific mentions, it's hard to tell which one was used here.

The user's questions are quite detailed, so I need to make sure each point is addressed. Since the provided text doesn't specify any of these details, each answer would be "Not described." 

I should also consider if there’s a supplementary section or methods part that might have this info, but since it's not included here, I can't access that data. Therefore, all six questions don’t have enough information to provide an answer beyond stating they're not described.

I need to present each answer clearly and concisely, ensuring the user understands that without specific details in the article, precise answers aren't possible.
