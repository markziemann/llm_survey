Abstract

Background

   Glucose is a primary osmotic agent in peritoneal dialysis (PD)
   solutions, but its long-term use causes structural alteration of the
   peritoneal membrane (PM). Hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG) is a
   promising alternative to glucose. This study was designed to compare
   the cellular responses of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) to
   these two different osmotic agents in a hypertonic solution using
   transcriptome analysis.

Methods

   Cultured HPMCs were repeatedly exposed to HPG-based or Physioneal 40
   (PYS, glucose 2.27%) hypertonic solutions. Transcriptome datasets were
   produced using Agilent SurePrint G3 Human GE 8 × 60 microarray.
   Cellular signaling pathways were examined by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
   (IPA). Protein expression was examined by flow cytometry analysis and
   Western blotting.

Results

   The HPG-containing solution was better tolerated compared with PYS,
   with less cell death and disruption of cell transcriptome. The levels
   of cell death in HPG- or PYS- exposed cells were positively correlated
   with the number of affected transcripts (HPG: 128 at day 3, 0 at day 7;
   PYS: 1799 at day 3, 212 at day 7). In addition to more affected
   “biosynthesis” and “cellular stress and death” pathways by PYS, both
   HPG and PYS commonly affected “sulfate biosynthesis”, “unfolded protein
   response”, “apoptosis signaling” and “NRF2-mediated oxidative stress
   response” pathways at day 3. PYS significantly up-regulated HLA-DMB and
   MMP12 in a time-dependent manner, and stimulated T cell adhesion to
   HPMCs.

Conclusion

   The lower cytotoxicity of hypertonic HPG solution is in agreement with
   its transient and minimal impact on the pathways for the “biosynthesis
   of cell constituents” and the “cellular stress and death”. The
   significant up-regulation of HLA-DMB and MMP12 by PYS may be part of
   its initiation of immune response in the PM.

Background

   Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a well-established life-saving renal
   replacement therapy for individuals suffering from end-stage renal
   disease (ESRD) [[44]1]. In PD the waste products and excess water are
   removed from the body by using a hypertonic solution via the peritoneal
   membrane (PM). At present, crystalloid glucose at concentrations of
   0.55 to 4.25% is the most commonly used osmotic agent in PD solutions
   such as Dianeal from Baxter (Deerfield, IL, USA). However, the
   incidence of ultrafiltration (UF) failure among PD patients increases
   with time on glucose-based PD required for effective new PD [[45]2,
   [46]3], and UF failure is one of main reasons for PD technique failure
   [[47]3]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that inclusion of glucose
   in the conventional PD solutions largely contributes to peritoneal
   membrane (PM) damage and UF failure [[48]4–[49]8], and its high level
   or long-term peritoneal load is positively correlated with an increase
   in all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, low residual renal
   function (RRF) and dialysate to plasma ratio of creatinine in PD
   patients [[50]9, [51]10]. Thus, it has been proposed that a non-glucose
   based biocompatible osmotic agent in a PD solution may preserve
   long-term integrity of PM structure and function, resulting in a delay
   in PD technique failure.

   Recently we have shown that hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG) based PD
   solutions at concentrations of 2.5–15% (w/v) increases the solution
   osmolality to 294–424 mOsm/kg and can maintain neutral solution pH
   (6.6–7.4) [[52]11–[53]13]. In a rat model of acute PD, HPG-based PD
   solutions produce similar or better fluid and waste removal while
   preserving the PM function compared to either Dianeal (2.5% glucose) or
   Physioneal (PYS) (2.27% glucose) [[54]11, [55]12]. Very recently, we
   have also demonstrated that HPG is superior to glucose for long-term
   preservation of the PM in a rat model of chronic PD [[56]13, [57]14].
   All these preclinical studies may suggest that HPG is a promising
   alternative to glucose in PD. However, the safety profiling of this
   polymer has not been fully assessed. In the current study, the
   objective was to investigate the global biological responses (as a
   measure of biocompatibility) of human peritoneal mesothelial cells
   (HPMCs) using a whole-transcriptome analysis after repeated exposure to
   HPG-based PD solution as compared to glucose-based conventional PYS.

Methods

Hypertonic PD solutions and cells

   HPG (1 kDa) was synthesized as described previously [[58]11, [59]12]. A
   hypertonic HPG PD solution (denoted as HPG here, approximately 402
   mOsmol/kg, pH 7.4) was prepared by dissolving HPG (1 kDa, 6% w/v) in a
   buffered electrolye solution that had the same composition as that of
   PYS without glucose: sodium chloride (538 mg/100 mL), sodium lactate
   (168 mg/100 mL), calcium chloride dehydrate (18.4 mg/100 mL), magnesium
   chloride hexahydrate (5.1 mg/100 mL) and sodium bicarbonate
   (210 mg/100 mL) [[60]11, [61]13, [62]14]. PYS (2.27% glucose, 395
   mOsmol/L, pH 7.4) was purchased from Baxter Healthcare Co. (Deerfield,
   IL, USA).

   The immortalized HPMCs were generated from primary HPMCs by
   immortalizing it with origin-deficient SV40 DNA and grown and
   maintained in complete K1^+/+ medium as described previously [[63]12].
   Jurkat cells, a human leukemic T cell line, were purchased from the
   American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA), and grown and
   maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

Repeated exposure of cells with hypertonic PD solutions

   Immortalized HPMCs (0.25 × 10^6 cells/well) were seeded in 24-well
   plates in complete K1 medium for 18 h, followed by 6 h in either PYS or
   HPG solution (total 24 h or a day) in a humidified 5% CO[2] incubator
   at 37 °C. This treatment cycle (18-h medium/6-h hypertonic solution)
   was continuously repeated for six more days/times.

Determination of HPMC growth or death rate

   At the end of 6 h treatment with either PYS or HPG in each treatment
   cycle, both cell death or growth of cultured HPMCs was determined by
   lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release using LDH assay kit (Roche Applied
   Science, Laval, QC, Canada) following the manufacturers’ protocol. In
   brief, after each time of exposure to HPG or PYS at 37 °C under a 5%
   CO[2] atmosphere, supernatants were collected from the wells, followed
   by complete lysis of remaining cells in a 2% Triton X-100 solution. The
   levels of LDH in both the supernatant and the cell lysate were measured
   at each time point. The cell death rate was calculated:
   % = LDH[s]/(LDH[s] + LDH[ce]) × 100, whereas growth or survival rate:
   % = LDH[ce]/LDH[0] × 100; where LDH[s] represented the LDH level in the
   supernatant and LDH[ce] the LDH level in the cell lysate at indicated
   time point, and LDH[0] indicated the total LDH level of seeded cells in
   untreated cell monolayer (0 h time point).

RNA extraction

   Five experimental groups were included in this study: untreated control
   at day 0, PYS at day 3 and 7, and HPG at day 3 and 7. Three separate
   cell samples were collected from each group. In brief, after 6 h of
   exposure to HPG or PYS, cells were detached with a Trypsin-EDTA
   solution and pelleted by centrifugation. Cell pellets were snap-frozen
   with liquid nitrogen first, and then stored in -80 °C until use. Total
   RNA was extracted from the cell samples by using mirVana™ isolation kit
   (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), and only the RNA samples with ≥8 of RNA
   Integrity Number (RIN) were used for below microarray analysis.

Microarray and ingenuity pathway analyses (IPA)

   A transcriptome database of each RNA sample was created by using
   Agilent SurePrint G3 Human GE 8 × 60 K Microarray kit (Agilent
   Technologies Canada Inc., Mississauga, ON) following a standardized
   protocol as described previously [[64]15]. These RNA sequencing
   datasets were then imported into GeneSpring GX (Agilent, Santa Clara,
   CA, USA), and were analyzed with 1.3 of –log[10] p value (p = 0.05)
   (t-test) and ≥ 1.5-fold change (FC) using IPA software (Ingenuity
   Systems, Redwood City, CA, USA) to compare the transcript profiling
   between groups.

   The affected gene transcript profile (both up-regulated and
   down-regulated) in each group was imported into the “Canonical Pathway”
   frame of the IPA software to determine whether or not the signaling
   pathways were significantly regulated by each treatment (HPG or PYS at
   day 3 or 7) as compared to controls, such as at day 3 or 7 compared to
   at day 0, or at day 7 compared to day 3.

Flow cytometry analysis

   The cell surface expression of HLA-DMB on HPMCs was determined by using
   flow cytometric analysis. In brief, cells were incubated with primary
   rabbit monoclonal anti-HLA-DMB antibody (ab133640, Abcam, Toronto, ON,
   Canada), followed by labeling with secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate
   (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (ab97050, Abcam), or
   with the secondary antibody only as a FITC background stain control.
   Stained cells were measured using a XL flow cytometer BD FACSCanto II
   (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada). The proportion of HLA-DMB
   positivity in the sample was presented by means of FITC light intensity
   (MFI) with anti-human HLA-DMB antibody.

Western blotting analysis

   Cellular levels of HLA-DMB protein in HPMCs were examined by Western
   blot analysis. Proteins in cellular protein extracts (50–100 μg per
   sample) were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE, and were then transferred
   onto nitrocellulose membrane. HLA-DMB protein (26–28 kDa) were
   identified by rabbit monoclonal anti-HLA-DMB antibody (ab133640,
   Abcam), and visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay
   (ECL: Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). Blots were
   re-probed using anti-Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
   antibody (Epitope Biotech., Vancouver, BC, Canada) to confirm the
   amount of loaded protein in each sample. The expression levels of the
   HLA-DMB were semiquantitatively determined using a densitometry, and
   were presented as a ratio of the HLA-DMB protein to GAPDH on the same
   blots.

T cell adhesion assay

   Cell adhesion of Jurket cells to monolayers of HPMCs was examined by
   using microscopic analysis. In brief, after repeated exposure of HPMCs
   with HPG, PYS or medium only (untreated control) for seven times as
   described above, cells (0.25 × 10^6 cells/well) were incubated in
   24-well plates overnight, followed by incubation with Jurkat cells
   (0.25 × 10^6 cells/well) at 37 °C, 5% CO[2] for 48 h. Non-adherent
   Jurkate cells were removed by washing four times with the culture
   medium. The bound Jurkat cells in each sample were counted in 10
   randomly selected high power fields (hpf, 400× magnification) using a
   light microscope, and were averaged.

Statistical analysis

   The difference between samples was analyzed by using two-tailed t-test
   or analysis of variance (ANOVA) (GraphPad Prism Software, GraphPad, San
   Diego, CA, USA) as appropriate. Data were presented as mean ± standard
   derivation (SD). A p value ≤0.05 was considered statistically
   significant.

Results

Cell growth recovery of HPMCs was improved in treatment with HPG but not with
PYS

   The impact of the hypertonic HPG solution compared to PYS control on
   HPMC survival was first determined by measuring LDH release. As shown
   in Fig. [65]1a, the death rate in HPG-treated cells was significantly
   lower than that in PYS control. In HPG group, the death rate was from
   23.71 ± 3.18% at the first treatment to 15.16 ± 1.63% for the last
   treatment, while in PYS group, it was from 51.06 ± 9.05% at the first
   treatment to 21.55 ± 3.49% for the last treatment (p < 0.0001, HPG vs.
   PYS, two-way ANOVA, n = 4). The death rate in both HPG- and PYS-treated
   cells gradually declined following each treatment, indicated by a
   statistically significant difference between time points (HPG:
   p = 0.0161, PYS: p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA) (Fig. [66]1a). When the
   cell growth was calculated after each treatment (Fig. [67]1b), data
   showed that there was a significant increase in cell growth in
   HPG-treated cells (from 77.67 ± 5.99% at the first treatment to
   330.66 ± 61.60% at the last treatment, p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA),
   whereas there was no significant change in PYS-treated cells. All these
   data suggested that following multiple exposures to HPG compared to
   PYS, there was less HPMC death in HPG groups compared to PYS group. At
   the same time, in each group cells became more tolerant to these
   non-physiologic solutions over time with the treatment.

   Cell death or growth of HPMCs in response to repeating exposure to
   hypertonic PD solutions. Immortalized HPMCs (0.25 × 10^6 cells/well)
   were seeded in 24-well plates in a culture medium for 18 h, followed by
   6 h in either PYS or HPG solution (total 24 h or a day) in a humidified
   5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The level of LDH release was determined at
   the end of each treatment cycle (18-h medium/6-h hypertonic solution)
   to calculate the percentage of cell death or growth of cultured HPMCs
   based on the baseline in untreated control at day 0. a Percentage of
   cell death. PYS vs HPG: p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, and cell death
   decline over time in PYS (p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA) or in HPG
   (p = 0.0161, one-way ANOVA). b Percentage of cell growth. HPG vs. PYS
   (p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA), and cell growth recovery over time in PYS
   (p = 0.0382, one-way ANOVA) or in HPG (p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA). Data
   were presented as mean ± standard derivation (SD) of four separate
   experiments (n = 4)

Less gene transcripts were affected in HPMCs by exposure to HPG than those by
PYS

   In order to see the molecular responses of cultured HPMCs to HPG or PYS
   in a time-dependent manner, the transcriptome in the HPMCs at day 0 (as
   a baseline or untreated control), day 3 and day 7 in response to both
   HPG and PYS were analyzed by using SurePrint G3 Human GE 8 × 60 K
   microarray that covered total 60,000 transcripts. In PYS group as
   compared to the untreated control (day 0), 1089 transcripts were
   downregulated and 527 upregulated at day 3, and 131 downregulated and
   63 upregulated at day 7 (Fig. [70]2, upper panel). Interestingly, the
   only difference in the transcriptome between at day 3 and at day 7 in
   PYS group was one upregulated transcript API5 (apoptosis inhibitor 5,
   FC = 2.4788, p = 0.0497). Whereas in the response to HPG, there were 53
   downregulated transcripts and 48 upregulated at day 3, and there was no
   significant change in the transcriptome at day 7 as compared to
   untreated control or at day 3 (Fig. [71]2, bottom panel).

   and day 7. Volcano plots of microarray data (three separate samples in
   each group, n = 3) of both PYS- and HPG-treated HPMCs at day 3 and day
   7 compared to untreated control, or the data at day 7 compared to those
   at day 3 using the Agilent Gene Spring software. Only the transcripts
   in these treated cells that were significantly changed (p ≤ 0.05;
   FC ≥ 1.5) compared to appropriate controls were included and presented
   in this analysis

Different signaling pathways were affected in HPMCs by exposure to different
hypertonic PD solutions and at different time points

   The canonical pathways analysis by using IPA software showed that the
   affected transcripts in HPMCs at day 3 of exposure to HPG solution were
   related to total 78 pathways, and among them 13 pathways were
   statistically significant (log[10] p ≤ − 1.3) (Table [74]1). While in
   PYS-treated HPMCs, the transcripts were related to total 424 pathways
   including 6 pathways that were significant (log[10] p ≤ − 1.3) at day
   3, and at day 7 there were total 161 pathways including 9 pathways
   significant (log[10] p ≤ − 1.3) (Table [75]1). There was little overlap
   in the significantly affected pathways between HPG and PYS groups or in
   PYS-treated cells between at day 3 and at day 7 (Table [76]1). It is
   interesting to note that the “unfolded protein response” pathway was
   the only significantly affected in both HPG- (log[10] p = − 2.01, at
   day 3) and PYS-treated cells (log[10] p = − 1.53, at day 7), and this
   pathway was less significantly affected in PYS group at day 3 (log[10]
   p = − 0.321). Other important functional pathways, such as “CDK5
   signaling”, “antigen presentation pathway”, “mitotic roles of Polo-like
   kinases” and “ephrin B signaling”, were either “not significantly” or
   “not in the list” of the affected pathways in both HPG and PYS groups
   at day 3, but were significantly affected in PYS-treated cells at day 7
   (log[10] p ≤ − 1.3) (Table [77]1).

   The total number of affected pathways was presented in each group
   (n = 3, three separate RNA samples). The p value was calculated by
   t-test as compared with the baseline control at day 0, and it was
   presented in a log[10] value (− 1.30 = 0.05). Nil: not in the list of
   affected pathways

   To further understand the differential impacts between HPG and PYS on
   HPMCs, the affected pathways were grouped into the “biosynthesis of
   cell constituents”, “cellular stress and death” and “interactions with
   leukocytes”. As listed in Table [79]2, HPG affected three
   “biosynthesis” pathways at day 3, including distinctively “diphthamide
   biosynthesis” with downregulated DPH6, and “S-adenosyl-L- methionine or
   cysteine biosynthesis III” with downregulated MAT2A and “dermatan,
   chrondroitin or heparan sulfate biosynthesis” with up-regulated CHST1.
   Whereas PYS affected more than twenty “biosynthesis” pathways at day 3,
   including “S-adenosyl-L- methionine or cysteine biosynthesis III” and
   the “dermatan, chrondroitin or heparan sulfate biosynthesis” as seen in
   HPG group but with more affected transcripts in each pathway (Table
   [80]2). At day 7, PYS only affected two pathways, which were the
   “dermatan, chrondroitin or heparan sulfate biosynthesis” with
   up-regulated CHST1 (the same as seen in HPG group at day 3) and
   “leukotriene biosynthesis” with downregulated MGST3 (similar to that in
   PYS group at day 3).

   Three separate RNA samples were included in each group (n = 3). The
   upregulated transcripts were highlighted in bold. Others were
   downregulated

   In the “cellular stress and death”-related pathways (Table [82]3),
   there were four pathways affected by HPG at day 3, “NRF2-mediated
   oxidative stress response” with downregulated DNAJC17 and EIF2AK3,
   “autophagy” with upregulated CTSK, “unfolded protein response” with
   upregulated HSPA8 and downregulated EIF2AK3, and “apoptosis signaling”
   with upregulated BCL2L11. In PYS-treated cells, all the pathways in the
   Table [83]3 were affected with more changed transcripts in each pathway
   at day 3, while at day 7, the number of the pathways was reduced to
   four as well as fewer changed transcripts were seen (Table [84]3).
   Overall, there were three pathways, the “NRF2-mediated oxidative stress
   response”, the “unfolded protein response” and the “apoptosis
   signaling,” commonly affected in all three groups, and “production of
   nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages” was affected
   only by PYS at both day 3 and day 7 (Table [85]3).

   Three separate RNA samples were included in each group (n = 3). The
   upregulated transcripts were highlighted in bold. Others were
   downregulated

   In the pathways mediating “interactions with leukocytes” (Table [87]4),
   only three transcripts were affected in HPG group, including
   downregulated TNFSF4 for “Th1 and Th2 pathways or T helper
   differentiation”, up-regulated CHST1 for “LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition
   of RXR function” and downregulated IL-22RA2 for “IL-22 signaling”.
   While in PYS group, all the “interactions with leukocytes” pathways
   (except of IL-22) listed in Table [88]4 were affected at day 3, and
   these pathways numbers were reduced to nine (with fewer transcripts in

   upregulation of both HLA-DMB and MMP12 by PYS in a time-dependent
   manner, which were indicated by the FC of HLA-DMB from 1.791 at day 3

Verification of HLA-DMB expression in HPMCs after exposure to hypertonic PD
solutions

   HLA-DMB is HLA class II beta chain that is required for MHC class
   II/peptide complex formation in the antigen presentation to T cells
   [[90]16]. As mentioned above, the expression of this molecule in HPMCs
   was significantly up-regulated by the exposure to PYS. There was also a
   1.57-fold increase in HLA-DMB expression in HPG-treated cells at day 3
   and a 2.43-fold increase at day 7 but these changes were not
   statistically different as compared to the baseline control in this
   sample size (n = 3). These microarray data were further confirmed using
   both flow cytometric and Western blot analyses. The increased cell
   surface levels of HLA-DMB were significantly higher in PYS-treated
   HPMCs than those in HPG-treated cells (p = 0.0036, two-way ANOVA,
   n = 4), evidenced by the ratio of PYS-treated cells to the baseline
   from 1.31 ± 0.2 at day 3 to 2.16 ± 0.21 at day 7, whereas in HPG group
   it was 1.08 ± 0.16 at day 3 to 1.69 ± 0.21 at day 7 (Fig. [91]3b). In
   Western blot analysis of total cellular HLA-DMB protein levels (Fig.
   [92]3c), HLA-DMB levels in PYS-treated cells were higher than those in
   HPG-treated cells at both time points. Taken together, these data
   suggested that the hypertonic PYS solution induced higher expression of
   HLA-DMB than HPG, which was significantly associated with “antigen
   presenting pathway” in PYS group at day 7 (Table [93]1).

   fractioned by 10% of SDS-PAGE, and HLA-DMB protein bands were
   identified based on specifically binding of anti-HLA-DMB antibody, and
   their molecular size (26–28 kDa) (upper panel). The protein content in
   each sample was confirmed by re-probing the blot with anti-GAPDH
   antibody (middle panel) and was measured by densitometry. Imaging data

Increased T cell adhesion to HPMCs after repeated exposure to hypertonic PD
solutions

   To investigate the functional implications of increased HLA-DMB and
   perhaps others such as MMP12 in HPMCs after exposure to hypertonic
   solutions, the level of T cell adhesion to these cells was examined.
   After repeated exposure to HPG or PYS for 7 days as described
   previously, HPMCs were co-cultured with Jurkat cells in a 1:1 ratio for
   48 h. After removal of all the non-adherent cells, the number of Jurkat
   cell sticking to HPMCs was counted. As shown in Fig. [96]4, the number
   of Jurkat cells in PYS was 108.8 ± 42.78 per hpf that was significantly
   higher than 45.5 ± 9.23 per hpf in HPG group (p = 0.0002, two-tailed
   t-test, n = 10), whereas in untreated cells with medium only it was
   14.2 ± 3.39 per hpf. These findings indicated the positive correlation
   of up-regulated expression of HLA-DMB and the others with an increase
   in T cell adhesion to the HPMCs after exposure to hypertonic solutions,
   and the effect of PYS was higher than HPG in this in vitro system.

Discussion

   Long-term exposure to a glucose-based PD solution is associated with
   inflammation and fibrosis in the PM [[99]17], which consequently result
   in its gradual functional impairment characterized by progressive
   reduction in solute transport or UF failure [[100]18]. However, the
   cytotoxic mechanism of the peritoneal response to a hypertonic PD
   solution has not yet been fully elucidated. A previous study has
   demonstrated that TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway is activated by the
   hypertonic solution in a chronic PD rat model, and possibly
   participates in the pathogenesis of PD related peritoneal fibrosis
   [[101]19]. Recent findings have suggested that epithelial-mesenchymal
   transition (EMT) of peritoneal mesothelial cells may play an important
   role in the failure of PM function [[102]20]. However, it is still not
   known that how these possible signaling pathways contribute to the
   inflammation and fibrosis seen in the peritoneum of PD patients. Thus,
   in this study, our primary goal was to reveal the biological pathways
   affected by a hypertonic solution in cultured HPMCs by transcriptome
   analysis. Since our previous studies demonstrated that the compact HPG
   is a superior biocompatible osmotic agent compared to glucose in rat
   models of PD [[103]11–[104]14], evidenced by the fact that the
   HPG-based hypertonic solution induces less PM damage than glucose-based
   PD solutions. However, the pathways mediating the difference in the
   “toxicity” between the HPG- and the glucose-based hypertonic PD
   solutions in the peritoneum have not been fully investigated. Thus our
   second goal in this study was to compare the pathways affected by the
   HPG solution with those by PYS in HPMCs using a whole-transcriptome
   analysis that is an emerging and continually growing field in assessing
   the safety of drugs or chemical risk assessment [[105]21, [106]22].
   This approach allows a more comprehensive understanding and a fuller
   knowledge of the “biocompatibility” of the agents/chemicals than those
   just based on several “biomarkers”.

   Cell death is an essential attribute of tissue damage. In this study,
   we showed that the levels of cell death in both HPG and PYS groups at
   different time points were positively correlated with the numbers of
   changed transcripts (both up-regulated and down-regulated) in HPMCs
   (Figs. [107]1 and [108]2). The IPA pathway analysis did not link the
   cell death induced by the hypertonic solution (either HPG or PYS) to
   any of these significantly affected pathways (Table [109]1). Instead,
   the “dermatan, chrondroitin or heparan sulfate biosynthesis”, “unfolded
   protein response”, “apoptosis signaling” and “NRF2-mediated oxidative
   stress response” were commonly affected by HPG at day 3 and by PYS at
   both time points, and in addition to more pathways by PYS at day 3 with
   more cell death (Tables [110]2 and [111]3). Interestingly, there was no
   single transcript commonly found in these pathways between HPG and PYS
   groups (Tables [112]2 and [113]3). These data suggest that the cell
   death induced by either hypertonic HPG or PYS solution may be primarily
   mediated by the disruption of “sulfate biosynthesis” and activation of
   “unfolded protein response”, “apoptosis signaling” and “NRF2-mediated
   oxidative stress” but their actions may be different at different time
   points due to regulating different transcript expression.

   It is interesting to note that over the time of exposure to PYS, cell
   death was remarkably decreased, or cells gradually became resistant to
   PYS-induced cell death (Fig. [114]1). At the same time, we found that
   only one transcript – API5 (apoptosis inhibitor 5) was significantly
   upregulated at day 7 as compared to day 3 (Fig. [115]2). We also
   noticed significant up-regulation of PPP1R10 (protein phosphatase 1
   regulatory subunit 10) at both day 3 and day 7 as compared to untreated
   control (Table [116]3). According to the GeneCards® Human Gene Database
   ([117]https://www.genecards.org/), PPP1R10 plays a role in cell cycle
   progression, DNA repair and apoptosis by negatively regulating the
   activity of protein phosphatase 1, a proapoptotic activator [[118]23,
   [119]24]. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that up-regulation of
   both PPP1R10 and API5, apoptosis inhibitors, may be part of the
   mechanism by which cell death resistance is induced by repeated
   exposure to PYS in this experimental system.

   Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of structural alterations and
   dysfunction of the PM during PD [[120]25], and exposure of a
   non-physiological, hypertonic PD solution is considered as a
   non-infective factor leading to chronic inflammation, macrophage
   infiltration and oxidative stress in the PM, resulting in UF failure in
   PD patients [[121]26]. However, the pathways by which the inflammation
   is initiated by a hypertonic PD solution in the PM are largely unknown.
   The transcriptome analysis in this study revealed many
   inflammation-related transcripts predominantly affected in PYS at both
   day 3 and day 7 (Table [122]4). The most notable of them were
   up-regulation of both HLA-DMB and MMP12, which were persistently
   induced by PYS at both time points (Table [123]4). The up-regulation of
   HLA-DMB protein was also confirmed by both flow cytometric and Western
   blot analyses (Figs. [124]3 and [125]4). HLA-DMB is the beta chain of
   the non-classical HLA class II heterodimer (HLA-DM) that plays a
   central role in the peptide loading of MHC class II molecules and
   initiation of an immune response to the antigen stimulation [[126]27,
   [127]28], and increases T cell adhesion to HPMCs (Fig. [128]4). This
   observation is supported by evidence in literature showing that HPMCs
   participate in antigen presentation, and T cell growth and adhesion
   [[129]29, [130]30], and the antigen presentation in the peritoneum
   stimulates resident population of effector memory T cells in PD
   patients [[131]31]. These peritoneal T cells, particularly CD8^+
   cytotoxic T cells, could play a destructive role for PM damage
   [[132]32]. MMP12 is a potent elastase, and its function is involved in
   many inflammatory conditions, such as the inflammatory process of
   respiratory diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary
   fibrosis and asthma) [[133]33], and mediation of inflammation and
   IL-13-induced liver fibrosis [[134]34] and inflammatory arthritis
   [[135]35]. In this study, we also showed increased T cell adhesion and
   up-regulated HLA-DMB expression in HPMCs after exposure to PYS (Fig.
   [136]4). All this evidence may indicate that both HLA-DMB and MMP12 are
   the local inflammatory mediators of the PM induced by exposure to
   hypertonic PYS or perhaps other PD solutions.

   Although positive correlations were obtained in our transcriptome
   analysis, the present study has several limitations. Firstly, the data
   were collected from cultured HPMCs, which may not represent the
   mesothelial cells in the PM of PD patients. The findings from this
   study need to be verified in clinical studies as well as in other
   experimental systems such as preclinical animal models. Secondly, we
   only tested PYS in this study. The results could be different when
   HPMCs are treated with other types of PD solutions such as Dianeal
   solutions or Extraneal (Icodextrin). Thirdly, we only measured the
   levels of the transcripts using microarray chips, which may not exactly
   reflect their protein levels. Also, the pathways due to the change of
   the transcripts were predicted using a bioinformatics analysis tool –
   IPA. Further studies are required to confirm the changes in the protein
   levels and their impacts on cell death, survival and inflammatory
   initiation.

Conclusions

   We have previously demonstrated the superior biocompatibility of
   HPG-based PD solutions over conventional glucose-based PD solutions in
   rat models of PD [[137]11–[138]14], but the molecular mechanisms have
   not been investigated. In this study, for the first time, we
   demonstrated that the lower cytotoxicity of the HPG solution to HPMCs
   in comparison to PYS correlated with its transient and mild effect on
   the pathways for the “biosynthesis of cell constituents” and the
   “cellular stress and death”. Both HPG and PYS commonly affected but in
   different characteristic pathways for “sulfate biosynthesis”, “unfolded
   protein response”, “apoptosis signaling” and “NRF2-mediated oxidative
   stress response”. In addition, exposure to PYS but not to HPG
   significantly upregulated HLA-DMB and MMP12 and increased T cell
   adhesion, which may be part of mechanism for the initiation of immune
   response and inflammation in the PM by the exposure to a glucose-based
   PD solution. We also have to acknowledge that less gene transcripts
   affected by HPG in cultured HPMCs may not necessarily reflect its
   superior biocompatibility over glucose in PD patients. Further
   evaluation of these findings in animal models of PD and in clinic is
   needed, which may provide a new therapeutic strategy to reduce the
   inflammation and structural alteration of the PM during PD.
