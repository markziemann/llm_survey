| 6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the analysis?    | Not described.                                                                                                                                                |

In summary, there was insufficient information provided in the article to fully understand the methods used for pathway enrichment analysis. The authors should have provided details of the method and statistical analysis in their article.
