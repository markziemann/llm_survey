Abstract

   We previously found that hypoxia induced renal tubular epithelial cells
   (RTECs) release functional extracellular vesicles (EVs), which mediate
   the protection of remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) for kidney
   ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. We intend to investigate whether
   the EVs were regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and
   Rab22 during RIPC. We also attempted to determine the potentially
   protective cargo of the EVs and reveal their underlying mechanism.
   Hypoxia preconditioning (HPC) of human kidney 2 (HK2) cells was
   conducted at 1% oxygen (O[2]) for different amounts of time to simulate
   IPC in vitro. EVs were isolated and then quantified. HIF-1α- and
   Rab22-inhibited HK2 cells were used to investigate the role of the
   HIF-1α/Rab22 pathway in HPC-induced EV production. Both normoxic and
   HPC EVs were treated in vivo to assess the protective effect of I/R
   injury. Moreover, microRNA (miRNA) sequencing analysis and
   bioinformatics analysis was performed. We revealed that the optimal
   conditions for simulating IPC in vitro was no more than 12 h under the
   1% O[2] culture circumstance. HPC enhanced the production of EVs, and
   the production of EVs was regulated by the HIF-1α/Rab22 pathway during
   HPC. Moreover, HPC EVs were found to be more effective at attenuating
   mice renal I/R injury. Furthermore, 16 miRNAs were upregulated in HPC
   EVs. Functional and pathway analysis indicated that the miRNAs may
   participate in multiple processes and pathways by binding their targets
   to influence the biochemical results during RIPC. We demonstrated that
   HIF-1α/Rab22 pathway mediated RTEC-derived EVs during RIPC. The HPC EVs
   protected renal I/R injury potentially through differentially expressed
   miRNAs. Further study is needed to verify the effective EV-miRNAs and
   their underlying mechanism.

Introduction

   Renal ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, the major cause of acute
   kidney injury (AKI), is a severe complication after major surgery and
   kidney transplantation. In addition, it is associated with increased
   morbidity and mortality[56]^1^,[57]^2. Therefore, it is imperative to
   develop potent interventions to prevent ischaemia-induced acute kidney
   injury.

   Ischaemic preconditioning (IPC), which was first described in the heart
   by Murry et al. [58]^3, consists of short sublethal cycles of
   ischaemia-reperfusion prior to the prolonged ischaemic insult.
   Subsequently, the phenomenon in which IPC of one organ was observed to
   protect remote organs, was defined as remote ischaemic preconditioning
   (RIPC) [59]^4. Currently, RIPC represents a more clinically practical
   strategy for limiting organ injury that has been successfully applied
   to the protection of cardiac, renal, and other organs against I/R
   injury [60]^5^,[61]^6. However, its mechanism is still largely unknown
   and has attracted much attention in recent years.

   A number of different mechanisms have been suggested, including roles
   for humoral mediators and neurally mediated mechanisms. As novel
   circulating mediators, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently been
   proposed to mediate the cardioprotection of RIPC [62]^7^,[63]^8. EVs
   are membrane-bound vesicles secreted from almost all cell types, which
   can modulate intercellular communication by transfer of their bioactive
   cargos [64]^9. According to different sizes and intracellular origins,
   EVs can be characterised into different categories, but two major
   subsets capture most of the interest: namely exosomes (30-150 nm
   diameter, which are derived from multivesicular bodies (MVBs)) and
   microvesicles (MVs) (100-1,000 nm diameter, which are shed from the
   plasma membrane) [65]^10.

   In our previous work [66]^11, we established a new animal model of RIPC
   firstly, which was IPC for right kidney protecting against I/R injury
   of left kidney. We found that hypoxia induced renal tubular epithelial
   cells (RTECs) to release functional EVs, which mediated the alleviation
   of kidney I/R injury.

   Here, to push our investigations further, we sought to answer two
   questions. Firstly, how does the hypoxia during RIPC regulate the
   secretion of EVs? Hypoxia is a central component of ischaemia, and the
   hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) transcription factor plays a
   crucial role in coordinating the transcriptional response to hypoxia
   [67]^12. HIF-1α-mediated organ protection in RIPC has been demonstrated
   both pre-clinically and clinically [68]^13^,[69]^14. Recent studies
   have indicated that hypoxia enhanced secretion of EVs in cancer cells
   in an HIF-1α-dependent manner [70]^15^,[71]^16.

   Moreover, Rab22 (also known as Rab22a), one of the small GTPases, has
   been found to be a downstream target of HIF-1α, and facilitates the
   shedding of breast cancer cells by MVs [72]^16. Actually, small GTPases
   of the Rab subfamily are involved in regulation of intracellular
   membrane trafficking events. To date, approximately 70 distinct Rab
   proteins have been identified in human systems with different Rab
   proteins being specific for distinct pathways that regulate the
   transport, docking and fusion of vesicles [73]^17. With reference to
   vesicular secretion, Rab11, Rab27 and Rab35 have been found to be
   involved in exosomal release via exocytosis in different cell lines in
   the former studies [74]^18, while Rab22 has been found to localise to
   endosomal compartments and to the plasma membrane and play a major role
   in endosomal function endocytic and phagocytic pathways
   [75]^18^,[76]^19. Here, enlighten by Wang's study [77]^16, we assume
   that the expression of Rab22 in RTECs is positively correlated with
   HIF-1α and the productions of RTEC-derived EVs are mediated by
   HIF-1α/Rab22 pathway during RIPC.

   EVs are believed to exert their functions by transfer their cargos to
   receptor cells. We supposed that the RIPC-induced EVs act as a
   protective role by changing their contents under hypoxia. Thus, the
   second question is whether the cargo changes of the RIPC induced EVs.
   The cargos of EVs are complex, including a great diversity of proteins,
   lipids and nucleic acids that can act as messengers for cell contacting
   [78]^20^,[79]^21. RNAs are proved to be the major bioactive cargos in
   EVs, along with some kinds of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs
   (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs)
   [80]^22. Among them, miRNAs are the most widely studied in the past
   years. We focused on miRNAs because both previous results and our study
   show the particular enrichment of miRNAs in EVs [81]^11^,[82]^23.
   Additionally, the roles of miRNAs in I/R injury have been gradually
   revealed recent years. Some of them were reported to alleviate I/R
   injury, such as miR-132, miR-21 and miR-489 [83]^24^-[84]^26, while
   some were proven to aggravate the injury, such as miR-24, miR-218 and
   miR-128-3p [85]^27^-[86]^29. Hence, we attempted to determine whether
   the changes of the miRNA profile in RIPC induced EVs, while the
   potentially functional miRNAs require further study.

   Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to investigate whether the
   RTEC-derived EVs are regulated by the HIF-1α/Rab22 pathway during the
   RIPC process. In addition, miRNA sequencing analysis and bioinformatics
   analysis were performed to find potentially protective miRNAs and their
   mechanism.

Materials and methods

Animal experiments

   All animal experiments were performed on male C57BL/6 mice, weighing
   20-25g (10-12 weeks of age), obtained from the Comparative Medicine
   Centre of Yangzhou University (Yangzhou, China). Mice were housed at a
   constant temperature, with a 12:12 h light-dark cycle and free access
   to water and rodent food. All protocols were approved by the Committee
   on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Southeast University (Nanjing,
   China). All surgeries were performed under intraperitoneal sodium
   pentobarbital anaesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimise
   suffering.

   RIPC was performed on the right kidneys after performing a back midline
   incision. For induction of RIPC, the right renal artery underwent 3
   cycles of 5 min of ischaemia and 5 min of reperfusion using
   non-traumatic microvascular clamps. Mice were killed 10 min, 30 min and
   24 h after reperfusion; and their bilateral kidneys and blood were
   collected for examination. For induction of IR, bilateral kidney was
   subjected to ischaemia for 35 min. For the treatment of renal I/R
   injury, PKH26-labelled EVs (50 μg suspended in 100 μl PBS) were
   injected intravenously 24 h before the operation of IR. Mice were
   killed 24 h after reperfusion, and their kidneys and blood were
   collected for examination.

Cell culture

   Human RTECs (HK-2 cells) were obtained from a commercial source
   (Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Shanghai, China) cultured
   in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12)
   medium (Thermo Fisher, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10%
   foetal bovine serum (FBS) (ExCell Bio, Shanghai, China), 100 μg/ml
   streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin, (Gibco, Thermo Fisher) within a
   humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO[2] at 37℃. For EV isolation,
   cells were cultured in conditioned media supplemented with
   exosome-depleted FBS (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Cell
   counts and quantification were performed using a hemocytometer, and
   viability was determined by 0.1% (w/v) Trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich,
   Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) exclusion.

Hypoxic preconditioning

   Hypoxic preconditioning (HPC), simulating IPC in vitro, was conducted
   within a hypoxic chamber at 1% O[2] and 37℃ in a 5% CO[2] humidified
   environment with the balance provided by nitrogen. The oxygen tension
   in the chamber was monitored and maintained by a computerised sensor
   probe. The time of HPC time was according to the experimental design.

Cell transfection and reagents

   Cell transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen;
   Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells
   were seeded in a 10-cm dish at 70% confluence one day prior to
   transfection. Nucleotides formed transfection complexes with
   Lipofectamine 2000, and were added to cells and incubated for 6-8 h
   prior to refreshing the medium. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were
   synthesised by GenePharma Co., Ltd., (Shanghai, China) based on the
   following sequences: HIF-1α siRNA: sense 5' CCAACCUCAGUGUGGGUAUdTdT 3'
   and antisense 5' AUACCCACACUGAGGUUGGdTdT 3', and Rab22 siRNA: sense 5'
   GGAUACAGGUGUAGGUAAAdTdT 3' and antisense 5' UUUACCUACACCUGUAUCCdTdT 3'.
   FAM labeled siRNA was used to assess the efficiency of transfection.
   Cells which expressed green fluorescence stably were considered to
   successful transfection. The efficiency of transfection was more than
   90% (Figure [87]S1).

Cell terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL)
assay

   To label nuclei of apoptotic cells, HK2 cells were plated on glass
   coverslips in a 35-mm dish under different treatment conditions, and
   then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde post-treatment. An In Situ Cell Death
   Detection Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was used to perform the
   terminal TUNEL staining, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The
   number of TUNEL-positive nuclei was counted and divided by the number
   of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained nuclei to calculate the
   percentage of TUNEL-positive cells.

Cell immunofluorescence assay

   Different treated HK2 cells, plated on glass coverslips in a 35-mm dish
   were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilised with 0.2% Triton
   X-100 and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The cells were
   then incubated with primary antibodies: monoclonal mouse anti-human
   HIF-1α (ab1, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and monoclonal rabbit
   anti-human RAB22A antibodies (ab137093, Abcam); followed by incubation
   with secondary antibodies: Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse
   immunoglobulin G (IgG, GB21301, ServiceBio, Wuhan, China) and
   fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
   (GB22303, ServiceBio). DAPI, (G1012, ServiceBio) was used to stain
   nuclei. The samples were visualised using the Pannoramic 250 Flash
   series digital scanner and software (3DHistech, Budapest, Hungary).

Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining

   The IHC kit (G1210, ServiceBio) was used for IHC staining. Kidney
   tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) and embedded in
   paraffin, and then cut into 4-μm thicknesses. The sections were
   incubated with primary antibodies: monoclonal mouse anti-human HIF-1α
   (1:100, ab1, Abcam) and polyclonal rabbit anti-human RAB22A (1:50,
   12125-1-AP, Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA) at 4℃ overnight. After
   washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the sections were then
   incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated IgG for 30 min,
   followed by 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB). Finally, the sections were
   counterstained with haematoxylin. The staining intensity of HIF-1α and
   RAB22A was assessed by two independent pathologists.

Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining

   To detect renal injury, kidneys were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH
   7.4), gradually dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, cut into 4-µm
   sections and subjected to PAS staining. Histopathological scoring was
   conducted in a blinded manner and given based on grading of tubular
   cell necrosis or swelling, tubular casts, brush border loss and
   interstitial infiltration by multi-nucleated cells in 10 randomly
   chosen, non-overlapping fields (200× magnification). According to the
   severity of changes on a semi-quantitative scale, scores were given as
   follows: 0 was no injury, 1 mild, 2 moderate, 3 severe and 4 very
   severe.

Plasma creatinine assay

   Blood samples were obtained through cardiac puncture at the indicated
   times. Plasma creatinine was measured using the sarcosine oxidase
   method by a commercial creatinine assay kit (C011-2, NJJC-Bio, Nanjing,
   China).

Extracellular vesicle extraction

   After culture in the presence or absence of hypoxia, conditioned medium
   was carefully collected and subjected to a series of centrifugation at
   800 g for 10 min, 2,000 g for 20 min and 10,000 g for 30 min at
   constant 4℃. The resultant supernatant was finally subjected to
   ultracentrifugation in a SW41 swing rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,
   CA, U.S.) for 1 h at 4℃ to collect EVs in pellets. EV pellets were
   resuspended in 100 µl of particle-free PBS for subsequent assays
   immediately or stored at 4℃ short-term (1-7 days) or -20℃ long-term.
   Cell counts and viability were also determined at the time of harvest
   as described above to account for differences in cell growth and
   normalisation of the cell numbers.

Nanoparticle tracking analysis(NTA)

   We completed NTA with ZetaView PMX 110 (Particle Metrix, Meerbusch,
   Germany) and corresponding software ZetaView 8.04.02 SP2. To analyse
   the size distribution and concentration of the EVs. Isolated EVs were
   appropriately diluted in particle-free PBS and resuspended before being
   injected into the sample cell chamber. Size distributions and particle
   concentrations were assessed at 11 positions. Polystyrene particles
   sized 110 nm were used to calibrate the ZetaView system. Temperature
   was maintained around 23℃ and 37℃. EV concentration analysis was
   normalised with the total number of cells from the corresponding dish.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

   TEM was conducted by the Electron Microscopy Core of Southeast
   University. Ten microlitres of EV pellet solution was loaded onto a
   formvar/carbon-coated 200-mesh copper electron microscopy grid,
   incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then subjected to negative
   staining with 3% aqueous phosphor-tungstic acid for 1 min. The grid was
   washed with particle-free PBS and allowed to semidry at room
   temperature before observation in transmission electron microscope
   (HITACHI H7650 TEM; Tokyo, Japan).

Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis

   For detecting EVs with FCM, the EVs that were resuspended in PBS were
   stained by the EVs-specific antibodies: FITC-conjugated anti-CD63
   (557288, BD, San Jose, CA, USA), FITC-conjugated anti-CD81 (557288, BD)
   for positive staining, or FITC-conjugated IgG1 (ab91356, Abcam) as a
   negative control. The fluorescence-labelled EVs were analysed with an
   Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD).

Western blotting analysis

   Cell lysate and EV proteins were extracted with ice-cold
   radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. Protein concentration was
   quantified with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Keygen Biotech, Nanjing,
   China). Total EV proteins loading for Western blot were normalised with
   the total cell number of the corresponding dishes as described above.
   Protein was separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
   (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) The membrane was blocked with 5%
   BSA for 1 h at room temperature and then immunoblotted with primary
   antibodies at 4℃ overnight. The blot membrane was then washed three
   times and incubated with secondary antibodies at 37℃ for 1 h. The blot
   signal was revealed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Beyotime,
   Shanghai, China). Primary antibodies used were monoclonal rabbit
   anti-human HIF-1α (1:500, ab51608, Abcam), monoclonal rabbit anti-human
   RAB22A (1:2000, ab137093, Abcam), polyclonal rabbit anti-human HSP70
   (1:1000, 10995-1-AP, Proteintech), monoclonal mouse anti-human TSG101
   (1:1000, MA1-23296, Thermo Fisher) and monoclonal mouse anti-human
   β-actin (1:3000, 7D2C10, Proteintech). Secondary antibodies used were
   HRP-labelled anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000, #7074, Cell Signalling
   Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:3000,
   #7076, Cell Signalling Technology).

Quantitative analyses of EVs

   We quantified the production of EVs mainly by EV-specific protein
   quantification. To increase the accuracy of quantitative analysis,
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot, these two
   methods were both used. For ELISA analysis, we used an ExoTEST™ kit for
   detecting CD9-positive EVs (exosomes) which was purchased from
   HansaBioMed (Tallinn, Estonia). The assays were performed in accordance
   with the manufacturer's instructions. For western blot, we used the
   protein levels of HSP70 as the indicator of EV quantity. Western
   blotting analysis was conducted as described above.

MicroRNA library construction and sequencing

   To analyse RNA contents in EVs, a Qiagen RNA isolation kit was used to
   extract total RNA and RNA was analysed using the Agilent 2100
   bioanalyser (Agilent Tech, U.S.). MiRNA profiling of EVs from normoxic
   and IPC HK2 cell culture medium was performed by the Professional Ribo
   Biotech Corporation (Guangzhou, China). Briefly, total RNA samples were
   fractionated on a 15% Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) polyacrylamide gel
   (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher) and small RNAs ranging between 18 and 30
   nucleotides (nt) were used for library preparation. Small RNAs were
   reverse transcribed and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
   The PCR products were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.
   The filtering criteria for up or downregulated genes were fold change
   of ≥ 2 and P < 0.05.

Bioinformatics analysis

   The putative target genes of miRNAs were determined through examination
   of the overlapped intersection from 3 databases (miRDB, TargetScan and
   miRWalk). Gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and
   Genomes (KEGG) were utilized to analyse the main function and
   significant pathways of the selected putative target genes. The
   filtering criterion of significance was defined as P < 0.05 for both GO
   and KEGG analyses. The potential regulatory networks between miRNAs and
   target genes were assembled and visualised using Cytoscape software. A
   directed edge (connection) from a miRNA to one of its targets exists if
   their relationship is functionally regulated. We then calculated the
   degree of the network that was defined as the number of neighbours
   (edges) of a node. The higher degree of connectivity that a given node
   has, the more biologically important role it plays in the regulatory
   network.

Statistical analysis

   All dates are expressed as means ± SD. Statistical analysis was
   conducted using SPSS 16.0 statistical software. Comparisons between two
   groups were performed by Student's t-test. For multiple comparisons,
   analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by post-hoc analysis
   using the least significant difference (LSD). P < 0.05 was considered
   statistically significant. Each experiment was conducted independently
   at least three times.

Results

Optimal conditions for simulating IPC in vitro with HK2 cells were no more
than 12 h under the 1% oxygen culture circumstance

   We screened the optimal conditions for simulating IPC in vitro with HK2
   cells mainly through biological changes, such as cell morphology,
   proliferation, apoptosis and the activation of HIF-1α. HK2 cells were
   divided to different groups, and HPC in 1% oxygen content environment
   from 0-72 h (Fig. [88]1a). We observed the gradual morphological
   changes of cells under the hypoxic environment after 24 h. Cells
   changed from a regular long spindle shape to irregular, disorganised
   shapes (Fig. [89]1b). Moreover, the number of cells significantly
   decreased as the hypoxic time increased, which reflected that prolonged
   hypoxic time influenced cell proliferation (Fig. [90]1c). There was no
   significant effect on cell apoptosis within 24 h, but significant
   apoptosis occurred in cells after 1% hypoxia more than 24 h (Fig.
   [91]1d and e). The expression level of HIF-1α was tested by western
   blot. With the prolongation of hypoxic time, the accumulation of HIF-1α
   in the cell reached a peak within 12 h. The increase of hypoxic time
   after 12 h did not increase the expression, while HIF-1α gradually
   degraded (Fig. [92]1f and g). In summary, through the above
   investigations, we believe that the optimal conditions for the
   simulation of IPC with HK2 cells should be no more than 12 h in a 1%
   oxygen content environment.

The changes of EVs production and characterisation after HPC

   EVs were isolated from the conditioned media of HK2 cells by serial low
   speed centrifugation followed by ultracentrifugation.

   Firstly, we examined the impact of HPC on EVs secretion in HK2 cells.
   The cells were exposed to normoxia or IPC for 6, 12 and 24 h. ELISA
   analysis indicated that the yield of CD9-positive EVs increased with
   the time of HPC. This trend reached a significant difference,
   particularly at 12 h and 24 h, respectively, 2.13-fold and 2.34-fold
   higher than normoxia (Fig. [95]2a). This time dependence was expected
   because more EVs were secreted into culture medium as the hypoxic
   incubation time increased. Our western blot analysis also showed a
   time-dependent increase of EV protein HSP70 under IPC, and this
   increase did not achieve statistical significance until 12 h (Fig.
   [96]2b, c). Therefore, to conduct follow-up analysis, we divided the
   EVs into the normoxia and HPC groups, and the EVs obtained from
   conditioned medium under the HPC environment for 12 h were selected to
   represent the HPC group for the above reasons.

   confirmed the presence of the EV proteins HSP70 and TSG101 and (h)
   semi-quantification after normalisation with equal cell numbers (*
   P<0.05).

   Furthermore, a serial of analysis was conducted to investigate the
   characterisation of normoxic and HPC EVs. Transmission electron
   microscopy revealed the both groups of EVs exhibited similar
   morphologies as round- (“cup”) or oval-shaped (“dish”) lipid bilayer
   vesicles (Fig. [99]2d). Samples examined by NTA showed that the size
   ranged from 30-500 nm in both groups. However, mean size was
   14943±487nm (normoxia) and 17390±330 (IPC), respectively. Both groups
   exhibited a peak at 120 nm, while another distinct peak at 240 nm was
   observed in HPC sample (Fig. [100]2e). Such results seemed to indicate
   that increased EVs produced in the HPC environment mainly concentrated
   in the size of 240 nm, which mainly belonged to MVs rather than
   exosomes. We also characterised four protein markers of EVs by FCM
   analysis and western blot analysis. FCM analysis detected CD63 and
   CD81, two widely accepted markers of EVs, in the isolated samples. As
   shown in Fig. [101]2f, the proteins of CD63 and CD81were positively
   expressed in normoxic or HPC EVs. Western blot of EV fractions
   confirmed the presence of the EVs proteins HSP70 and TSG101 (Fig.
   [102]2g). As expected, the HPC EV sample showed higher content of HSP70
   and TSG101 than that of normoxia after normalisation with equal cell
   numbers (Fig. [103]2h). Moreover, more total RNAs could be extracted
   form HPC EV samples than normoxic ones after cell number normalisation.
   Bioanalyser profile of EVs showed the presence of different subsets of
   RNAs and, in particular, enrichment for small RNAs (about 25 nt) (data
   not shown).

   These results not only verify our EV isolation protocol but also
   indicate that HPC can enhance the EV production of HK2 cells and
   influence some characteristics of EVs.

The production of EVs was regulated by the HIF-1α/Rab22 pathway during IPC

   IPC-enhanced Rab22 expression was HIF-1α-dependent in vivo and in
   vitro. IHC was conducted to detect HIF-1α and Rab22 protein expression
   in the IPC and sham mice kidneys. Results showed that HIF-1α was
   expressed strongly in IPC renal tubules with the expression of Rab22
   enhanced accordingly. These 2 proteins showed a synchronic expression
   in vivo (Fig. [104]3a, b). Furthermore, HK2 cells were exposed to
   normoxia or HPC, harvested and tested at different time points. Both
   western blot analysis (Fig. [105]3c, d) and immunofluorescent assay
   (Fig. [106]3e, f) revealed that hypoxic exposure gradually affected the
   expression of HIF-1α and Rab22 in cells, and both of them peaked at the
   time point of HPC for 12 h but decreased at HPC for 24 h. These results
   were in agreement with the results in vivo. To further prove the role
   of HIF-1α in hypoxia-induced Rab22 expression in tubular epithelia, we
   turned to gene expression-inhibited cells. Therefore, we established
   HIF-1α and Rab22 knockdown HK2 cells by transfecting HIF-1α and Rab22
   siRNA. Compared with negative control (NC), scrambled
   sequence-transfected cells and HIF-1α siRNA-transfected cells had both
   lower HIF-1α and Rab22 expressions under hypoxic conditions. However,
   Rab22 siRNA-transfected cells had only decreased Rab22 expressions.
   These results indicated that hypoxia enhanced HIF-1α-dependent Rab22
   expression (Fig. [107]3g, h).

   We further tested the HIF-1α- or Rab22- inhibited HK2 cells to
   investigate the role of the HIF-1α/Rab22 pathway in HPC-induced EV
   production. We quantified the production of EVs by western blot and
   ELISA analysis. The no gene expression-inhibited cells under the HPC
   produced more EV protein HSP70 than cells in normoxia. However, HIF-1α-
   inhibited cells nearly eliminated the increase in EVs production under
   the HPC, compared to NC cells. Similarly, the HPC-induced EVs
   production was also largely attenuated in Rab22- inhibited cells (Fig.
   [110]3i, j). Consistently, ELISA analysis indicated that HPC induced
   the expression of EV protein CD9 was also suppressed in HIF-1α, and
   Rab22 inhibitedHK2 cells (Fig. [111]3k). These results revealed that
   HPC-induced EVs were regulated by the HIF-1α/Rab22 pathway.

HPC EVs were more effective to attenuate mice renal I/R injury than normoxic
EVs

   To investigate the role of EVs in I/R injury protection, 4 groups of
   mice models were studied: sham surgery (sham), bilateral renal
   ischaemia reperfusion injected with PBS (IR+PBS), or with EVs from HK2
   cells cultured under normoxic conditions (IR+NOR EV), or with EVs from
   post hypoxic HK2 cells (IR+HPC EV). To mimic the process that EVs
   derived from the RTECs during RIPC that we injection the hypoxic EVs
   before I/R injury, and PKH26 labelled-EVs or PBS vehicle were given
   intravenously 24 h pre-ischaemia (Fig. [112]4a). No mortality was
   observed during the operation.

   conditions (IR+NOR EV) or with EVs from HPC HK2 cells (IR+HPC EV); *,
   #, P<0.05 compared with SHAM, IRI+PBS, respectively).

   By PAS staining, we observed that all renal tubules were damaged in the
   I/R injury group compared with sham surgery animals. After treatment
   with EVs, the morphological changes of the kidney were alleviated and
   only the group treated with HPC EVs reached a statistically
   significant, difference compare with the PBS-treated group (Fig.
   [115]4b, c). Renal function was evaluated using serum creatinine (SCr).
   Results showed Scr levels in sham-operated mice remained within normal
   limits. In contrast, there was a rapid and similar increase in SCr in
   all I/R injury groups after 24 hours. Similarly, SCr was lower in the
   EV-treated group than in the PBS-treated group, and HPC EVs treated
   group had a significant difference than the PBS-treated group (Fig.
   [116]4d). This means that HPC EVs but not the EVs, could significantly
   improve renal function of ischaemic injured kidneys.

HPC modulated the expression of a subset of miRNAs in EVs

   To discover candidate EV-packaged miRNAs (EV-miRNAs) associated with
   renal protection induced by HPC, we utilized miRNA sequencing for
   expression profiling of miRNAs in HPC and normoxic cell derived EVs
   (Table [117]S1). A total of 16 differentially expressed EV-miRNAs (fold
   change ≥2, P value<0.05) were initially screened, and they were all
   upregulated in HPC versus the normoxic group. Detailed information of
   the 16 differentially expressed EV-miRNAs is summarised in Fig. [118]5.

Prediction and pathway enrichment analysis of target genes of differentially
expressed miRNAs

   In order to further reveal the role of upregulated EV-miRNAs during
   HPC, online miRNA prediction databases miRDB, TargetScan and miRWalk
   were used to identify their putative target genes. The results showed
   that 438 common putative target genes can regulated by 13 of the
   dysregulated EV-miRNAs identified in our screen (Fig. [121]6a), while 3
   miRNAs, including miR-127-3p, miR-136-3p and miR-411-5p, had no common
   predicted genes. Among the dysregulated EV-miRNAs, miR-124-3p had the
   highest number of target genes with the number of 119, while the others
   had no more than 60, with the numbers between 6-58 (Fig. [122]6b).

   Furthermore, to determine the potential function of these dysregulated
   EV-miRNAs, we performed enrichment analysis for the 438 common putative
   target genes utilizing GO terms. Results associated with these genes
   were related to the cell proliferation, cellular respiration,
   transcription, response to dietary excess, stem cell population
   maintenance, signal transduction, blood vessel development and protein
   deubiquitination (Fig. [125]6c), demonstrating that these EV-miRNAs are
   probably related to I/R injury protection. The target genes of these
   EV-miRNAs are also primarily located in cytoplasmic stress granule,
   clathrin-coated vesicle, early endosome, dendritic spine, etc. (Fig.
   [126]6d), with transcriptional activator/repressor activity, DNA
   binding, phosphatidylinositol binding, ATP binding, etc. as the
   dominating dysfunctional molecular function annotations (Fig. [127]6e).

   We studied the KEGG pathways of selected target genes so as to further
   uncover the biological function of the EV-miRNAs (Figure. 6f). The most
   enriched dysfunctional pathways included the insulin signalling
   pathway, Wnt signalling pathway, FoxO signalling pathway and mTOR
   signalling pathway, etc. The KEGG pathway analysis reveals the function
   of the signature EV-miRNAs partly, and signal-related function was
   highlighted among all the subsystems, which was consistent with GO
   terms of these selected genes.

Integration of a regulatory network for miRNA-target genes

   We assembled and visualised the associations between the miRNAs and
   target genes by constructing a regulatory network for miRNA-target
   genes utilizing the Cytoscape. The degree of the network was defined as
   the number of edges of a node. The nodes with a higher degree
   centrality are considered biologically more important genes within the
   networks. In our study, the higher-degree interactive network contained
   9 miRNAs, 15 genes and 31 miRNA-target gene connections (Fig. [128]7).
   These genes were target by more than one dys-regulated miRNAs might
   play more important roles in I/R injury protection.

Discussion

   Our previously work was the first to establish a new animal model of
   RIPC, which was right kidney IPC protecting against I/R injury of left
   kidney [131]^11. At approximately the same time, Tuorkey et al.
   [132]^30 reported a similar kidney RIPC model, demonstrating that
   kidney RIPC showed better efficacy against I/R injury as a novel and
   applicable model. We revealed that transient ischaemia/RIPC of right
   kidney could affect RTECs, making the latter releasing functional EVs
   to alleviate I/R injury of remote left kidney through the circulatory
   system in an EV-dependent manner. In the current study, we used human
   RTECs to simulate RIPC in vitro, indicating that the EV production is
   enhanced by HPC, This has been further proven to be partly regulated by
   the HIF-1α/Rab22 pathway. In addition, the HPC cell derived-EVs reveal
   a protective function of renal I/R injury in mice. Then, miRNAs, one
   category of the main cargos of EVs are identified to find potentially
   protective EV-packed miRNAs and their underlying mechanisms.

   Multiple pathophysiological responses are believed to contribute to the
   I/R injury, such as increase of intracellular calcium, pH changes,
   depletion of adenosine triphosphate, generation of reactive oxygen
   species (ROS), changes of mitochondrial pore permeability, activation
   of macrophages and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which
   ultimately from the basis of tissue damage and cellular death
   [133]^31^-[134]^33. Current recognition of cellular ''cross-talk'' and
   molecular events have introduced new logical strategies to sequentially
   combat the events occurring in relation to I/R injury, which includes
   preconditioning strategies. Actually, either direct or remote IPC,
   which is a short period of oxygen deprivation and reperfusion, protects
   various tissues against subsequent sustained ischaemic insults to
   reduce the extent of injury. Studies have demonstrated that IPC/RIPC
   can protect organs suffering from I/R injury via promoting cell
   proliferation and inhibiting cell apoptosis [135]^34^-[136]^36.
   Furthermore, this procedure itself is not considered to cause
   noteworthy injury to the organs. It has been proven that IPC/RIPC
   regulates HIF-1α levels and apoptosis to attenuate organ injury
   [137]^14^, [138]^37^-[139]^39. Therefore, in the present study, we
   investigated the optimal conditions to simulate IPC in vitro and
   focused on cell proliferative and apoptotic events, as well as the
   regulation of the HIF-1α. We drew the conclusion that optimum
   conditions to simulate IPC in vitro with HK2 cells were no more than 12
   h under the 1% oxygen culture circumstance. Because we observed that
   hypoxic exposure of HK2 cells within 12 h had no significant effect on
   proliferation and apoptosis, while the HIF-1α levels in cells increased
   dramatically and peaked at approximately 12 h.

   EVs have recently been proved to play an important role in RIPC-induced
   protection of the myocardium ischaemic injury
   [140]^7^,[141]^40^,[142]^41. However, the report on the role of EVs in
   the RIPC-induced renal ischaemic protective process is still rare.
   According to our pervious data, we believe that the protective EVs were
   induced by hypoxia during the process of RIPC. Our present data
   [143]^11 indicate that EV production in RTECs is increased remarkably
   during hypoxia, which is consistent with previous studies in malignant
   cells [144]^15^,[145]^16. Consistently, Borges et al. [146]^42 showed
   the increase of production of exosome during hypoxia of mouse and human
   RTECs. Besides, Zhang et al. [147]^43 also evaluated the enhanced
   production of exosome during hypoxia of rat RTECs by complementary
   techniques, suggesting the induction of exosomes under hypoxia
   conditions. Noteworthily, our hypoxia condition was observed to more
   favourable to the increase of production of the MVs than the exosomes
   when evaluated by nanoparticle tracking assay. This tendency was not
   noticed before.

   Our work has further demonstrated a crucial role of HIF-1α/Rab22
   pathway in EVs production during HPC in HK2 cells. It has been proved
   that hypoxia-mediated exosome production is HIF-1α-dependent both in
   malignant cells and benign epithelial cells
   [148]^15^,[149]^16^,[150]^43. However, the specific downstream target
   genes whereby HIF-1α regulates EVs under hypoxia is unclear. Wang et
   al. [151]^16 demonstrated hypoxia-induced increased MVs formation in an
   HIF/Rab22-dependent manner in breast cancer cells, and Rab22 was proven
   to be a direct HIF target gene. Inspired by this study, we investigated
   HIF-1α-dependent Rab22 expression both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover,
   hypoxia-induced EV production was decreased both in HIF-1α-inhibited
   and Rab22-inhibited HK2 cells. Together, these results support the role
   of the HIF-1α/Rab22 pathway in mediating EV biogenesis and secretion in
   HPC RTECs.

   Our previous study has shown that EVs derived from HPC HK2 cells had
   obvious therapeutic effects for rat renal I/R injury [152]^11. However,
   we didn't compare the efficacy with non-HPC EVs. The results cannot be
   adequately demonstrated that the therapeutic effect was due to HPC
   implementation. Our current results show that, to mimic RIPC,
   pre-injection of HPC EVs can significantly attenuate subsequent mice
   renal I/R injury and improve renal function of I/R injured kidneys
   rather than normoxic EVs. The results have amply confirmed the unique
   kidney I/R injury protective function of HPC EVs. Actually, hypoxic
   cell derived-EVs were always demonstrated to promote tumour growth,
   invasion and metastasis and were also reported to be pro-fibrotic
   during kidney fibrosis rather than physiological protection
   [153]^16^,[154]^42^,[155]^44^-[156]^46. Consistent with our results,
   Dominguez et al. [157]^47 showed that EVs from adult rat RTECs
   successfully treat rats with established severe I/R injury
   intravenously 24 and 48 h after I/R. Furthermore, EVs from HPC cells
   were more effective. Taken their and our results together, the HPC EVs
   derived from RTECs can alleviate both subsequent and established renal
   I/R injury. Zhang et al. [158]^43 suggested that exosomes from hypoxic
   RTECs could prevent RTEC apoptosis after ATP depletion. Their study
   indicated a time window for RTECs to produce cellular protective
   exosomes under hypoxic exposure. Interestingly, the exosomes extracted
   during 16 and 24 h of hypoxic exposure were protective, however those
   extracted from over 24 h of hypoxic exposure were no more protective.
   This time window in their work further prove the rationality of our
   choice of optimal conditions of simulate IPC in HK2 cells in turn.

   Here, we successfully injected human EVs into immunocompetent mice.
   Previous studies haven shown that not only allogeneic but also
   xenogenic EVs could induce some therapeutic effects in immunocompetent
   small and large animal models, and no significantly acute immune
   rejection was elicited [159]^48^-[160]^52. Possible reasons is that the
   EVs are acellular therefore likely to be less immunogenic than cells.
   On the other hand, EVs have been suggested to be able to modulate
   immunity [161]^53^, [162]^54. Particularly in our study, another
   possible reason is that normal renal tubular epithelial cells express
   very low or negative major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Ⅱ and
   costimulatory molecules (e.g. CD80 and CD86) which impair the
   activation of immune cells [163]^55^, [164]^56. However, the phenomenon
   and its specific mechanisms still requires further investigation.

   How do the EVs from HPC cells protect renal I/R injury? Our present
   study does not conclude a clear answer to the question. Nonetheless,
   HPC may change the cargos of EVs that are considered to be the primary
   mediators affecting recipient cells [165]^22^,[166]^46^,[167]^47. Our
   interests focus on miRNAs, because our results show the particular
   enrichment of small RNAs (about 25 nt) in EVs, and the role of miRNAs
   in I/R injury has been gradually revealed in recent years. Our study
   found a total of 16 differentially expressed EV-miRNAs, and all of them
   were up-regulated in HPC EVs versus normoxic EVs. At present, many of
   these miRNAs have been reported to play various roles in
   hypoxic/ischaemic insult (Table [168]S2). Some of the miRNAs have
   attracted more attentions, some are not. The mechanisms by which these
   miRNAs act are varied. Sometimes, the effect of the same miRNA might be
   reported to the contrary conclusion. This suggests that we need to pay
   more attention to the role of miRNAs in IPC, RIPC or I/R injury. To
   deepen the understanding of biological functions of these EV-miRNAs, we
   utilized three online miRNA-target-predicting database (miRBD,
   TargetScan and miRWalk) to predicte the target genes. Target genes
   located in the intersection of three databases were chosen for further
   analyses so that to reduce false positives. Results showed these
   up-regulated EV-miRNAs were associated with 438 target genes. To
   further understand the role of these up-regulated miRNAs, pathway
   enrichment analysis was performed on all 438 genes. Our results
   indicated that these target genes were involved multiple processes,
   such as cell proliferation, cellular respiration and transcription.
   Moreover, multiple pathways, such as the insulin signalling pathway,
   Wnt signalling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway and mTOR signalling
   pathway, etc. are involved. These miRNAs are suspected of influencing
   the corresponding processes and pathways in RIPC/IPC by binding their
   targets, thereby affecting the consequences of I/R injury. Our
   miRNA-target gene regulatory network shows that a single miRNA can
   target multiple genes, and different miRNAs can regulate the same gene.
   These genes are considered biologically more important genes in the
   network and are supposed to play more vital roles in I/R injury
   protection. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3),
   was demonstrated to be required and dependent on the RIPC to ameliorate
   pulmonary I/R injury [169]^57. Similarly, Wang et al. reported that
   RIPC attenuated diabetic heart I/R injury by mitigating high
   glucose-induced protein kinase C (PKC)-ԑ overexpression and,
   subsequently, activating STAT3 [170]^58. Paradoxically, inhibition of
   STAT3 phosphorylation was reported to promote neurological function
   recovery following ischaemic stroke by RIPC treatment or epigenetically
   regulated with miR-126a [171]^59^,[172]^60. Inhibiting specificity
   protein 1 (SP1) by miR-374 could exert protective effects by activating
   the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/protein kinase B
   (PI3K/AKT) pathway in rat models of myocardial I/R after sevoflurane
   preconditioning [173]^61. However, another study revealed that EVs from
   human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stromal cells
   (hiPSC-MSCs) protect against kidney I/R injury via transmitting SP1,
   and transcriptional activating of sphingosine kinase 1 and inhibiting
   necroptosis [174]^62. In addition to these studies, peroxisome
   Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1 Alpha (PPARGC1A), a
   well characterised positive regulator of mitochondrial function and
   oxidative metabolism has been shown to regulate oxidative stress, which
   is directly associated with IPC and I/R injury [175]^63^,[176]^64.
   Inhibiting the expression of nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (NRCOA1)
   has been shown to reduce inflammation and apoptosis and thus protect
   the rat and cell models of cerebral I/R injury [177]^65. Huang et al.
   [178]^66 reported that I/R injury influenced DNA hydroxymethylation and
   tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) gene expression in mouse
   kidneys, which may contribute to the regulation of gene transcription
   during renal I/R injury. Recently, there have been several reports
   about the role of related genes in preconditioning or I/R injury.
   However, some conclusions about the role of genes are actually
   contradictory, and there are still many genes involved in
   preconditioning or I/R injury that remain to be studied further. In
   short, the function of the differentially expressed EV-miRNAs and their
   target genes in RIPC-induced renal I/R injury protection remain largely
   unknown. Further insight to these regulatory mechanisms will facilitate
   to the management of renal I/R injury.

   Limitations in our study should be noted. Firstly, we tried to uncover
   the mechanism of RIPC to alleviate renal I/R injury by producing
   protective EVs through simulation of IPC in vitro. However, the actual
   biochemical reactions in vivo are quite complex, and the conditions in
   vitro are still very different. Secondly, due to the limitations of
   hardware and funding, we used the transient transfected cells rather
   than stable HIF-1α, Rab22-deficient or over-expressed cell lines, which
   partly influenced the persuasion of the experimental results. In
   addition, the reliability of our results would be greatly enhanced if
   renal-specific HIF-1α and Rab22 knockdown animal models were studied.
   However, it is still difficult to say the production of IPC EVs depends
   entirely on HIF-1α and the downstream pathway because many
   transcription factors as well as cellular signalling pathways are
   activated during RIPC that may mediate the effect. Moreover, EVs play a
   biological regulatory role through their nucleic acid, protein and
   other contents, although our focus was only on miRNAs. Lastly, these
   differentially expressed miRNAs, regardless of their expression,
   function and underlying mechanism, need to be further verified in vitro
   and in vivo in the future.

   In summary, in this study, we demonstrated that the HIF-1α/Rab22
   pathway regulated the production of RETC-derived EVs during RIPC. The
   HPC EVs protected renal I/R injury potentially through differentially
   expressed EV-miRNAs. Further study is needed to verify the effective
   EV-miRNAs and underlying mechanism.
