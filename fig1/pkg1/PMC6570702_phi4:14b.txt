Here is an examination of how the pathway enrichment analysis was conducted based on the provided article:

1. **Tool Used for Pathway Enrichment Analysis:**
   - The tool used for pathway enrichment analysis is not explicitly described in the Methods section.

2. **Tool Version Number Provided:**
   - No version number for the tool is provided in the article.

3. **Gene Set Library Queried:**
   - Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used for pathway enrichment analysis, as mentioned in other sections of the article.

4. **Background Gene List Defined:**
   - The background gene list is not explicitly defined in the Methods section. Typically, it would be all genes detected or annotated within the experimental context.

5. **Statistical Test Used for Enrichment Analysis:**
   - The specific statistical test used for enrichment analysis is not described in the article.

6. **False Discovery Rate Correction Used:**
   - It is mentioned that the results were filtered by a false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05, indicating that FDR correction was applied to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis.

Here is the collated information in table format:
