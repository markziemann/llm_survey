Thinking...
We need to locate details about pathway enrichment analysis in the Methods. Search text for "enrichment". In Materials and methods section, there is "Statistics" and "GSEA". Let's read.

In Methods, after "Gene annotations were obtained from Vectorbase using BioMart. Functional groups were assigned to the following categories: ...". That is classification, not enrichment.

Earlier in Results, they talk about "GSEA", "Gene set enrichment analysis". Let's locate.

In the article: I recall reading "For GSEA, the mitochondrial and redox categories were combined". So they used GSEA? But maybe they used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) conceptually to test for over-representation of functional groups among high association set. Let's search.

In "Statistics" paragraph: "Descriptive statistics were calculated in R (version 3.0.2). The ratio of variant sites per nucleotide of aligned reads was calculated as follows: binomial probability distributions were performed and hypergeometric tests were calculated; each functional subset was compared to the corresponding group within the set of all coding genes (n = 14,626). This analysis allowed us to identify the gene sets that were enriched compared to similar categories among all coding genes."

So they performed hypergeometric tests for functional subsets. That is enrichment analysis. Did they use a tool? Not described as a specific software; they used "hypergeometric tests" probably implemented in R. No specific tool like DAVID.

In the "Functional groups were assigned to the following categories:" they listed categories and then "For GSEA, the mitochondrial and redox categories were combined". So they mention GSEA, but GSEA is a method (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) but also a tool; they may be using the term generically. They say "For GSEA, the mitochondrial and redox categories were combined". That suggests they used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis conceptually, but not a specific tool. No version.

Thus answer:

Tool used: Not described? Actually they didn't mention a tool; they just performed hypergeometric test. So "Not described". Or maybe they used "Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate" for gene-wise averages, not enrichment. That is separate. For enrichment they used hypergeometric test, but no tool.

Thus table:

Tool(s) used for pathway enrichment analysis: Not described

Version(s): Not described

Gene set libraries: Not described

Custom background: Not described (maybe they used all coding genes as background; they said "compared to corresponding group within the set of all coding genes". That indicates they used all coding genes as background. So answer: Yes? Actually they described using "each functional subset was compared to the corresponding group within the set of all coding genes (n = 14,626)." That's a background list. So "Yes".

Statistical test: hypergeometric test

Multiple testing correction: Not described (they did hypergeometric test and maybe used p-value threshold, but not FDR). So "No".

Now format table with rows for each question.

...done thinking.
