Okay, let me try to figure out the answers to these questions based on the provided article. First, I need to look through the Methods section and other relevant parts to find information about the pathway enrichment analysis.

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**  
The article mentions "pathway enrichment analysis" but I need to check if they specify the tool. In the Methods section, they might have used DAVID, GSEA, or another tool. Let me scan through. The Results section refers to KEGG pathways, so maybe they used DAVID or another tool that supports KEGG. Wait, in the Methods section under "Bioinformatics Analysis," it says they performed pathway enrichment analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. But the tool isn't explicitly named. Hmm, sometimes KEGG analysis is done through their own tools, but other tools like DAVID or clusterProfiler can also use KEGG. The article might not specify the exact tool. Let me check again. The user is asking for the tool, not the database. The article says "pathway enrichment analysis was conducted using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database." So maybe the tool is KEGG's own tool. Alternatively, maybe they used another tool to query KEGG. But the answer might be that the tool isn't specified, just that they used the KEGG database. Wait, the user is asking for the tool, not the database. The article doesn't mention a specific tool like DAVID or GSEA. So the answer is not described.

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**  
Since the tool isn't specified, the version number isn't provided either. Answer: not described.

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**  
The article mentions using the KEGG database for pathway enrichment analysis. So the answer is KEGG.

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**  
The article doesn't specify whether a background gene list was used. It just says they used the KEGG database. So answer: not described.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**  
The article doesn't mention the statistical test. For example, they might have used Fisher's exact test, hypergeometric test, etc. Since it's not stated, answer: not described.

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**  
The article doesn't mention any correction method like FDR. So answer: not described.

Let me double-check. In the Methods section under "Bioinformatics Analysis," it says: "Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database." No tool is named beyond that. The other questions are not addressed. So the answers are as above.

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**  
   Not described. The article mentions using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database but does not specify a particular tool for the analysis (e.g., DAVID, GSEA, or others).

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**  
   Not described. No version number is mentioned for the tool or database used.

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**  
   Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**  
   Not described. The article does not clarify whether a specific background gene list (e.g., all genes on the platform or a curated list) was used.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**  
   Not described. The article does not specify the statistical method (e.g., hypergeometric test, Fisherâ€™s exact test).

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**  
   Not described. No mention of correction methods (e.g., FDR, Bonferroni) is provided.
