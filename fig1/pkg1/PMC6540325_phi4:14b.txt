Based on the information provided from the article, here is how the pathway enrichment analysis appears to be conducted:

1. **Tool Used for Pathway Enrichment Analysis:**
   - The tools mentioned include GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) for pathway enrichment analysis.

2. **Tool Version Number Provided:**
   - Not described in the article.

3. **Gene Set Library Queried:**
   - Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).

4. **Background Gene List Defined:**
   - Not explicitly described in the article, but typically this would involve using all genes represented on the microarray platform or a similar comprehensive list relevant to the study.

5. **Statistical Test Used for Enrichment Analysis:**
   - The specific statistical test used is not detailed in the provided text. Typically, such analyses might use Fisher's exact test or chi-squared tests, but this would need to be confirmed by reviewing more of the original article.

6. **False Discovery Rate Correction Used:**
   - Not described in the article. However, it is common practice in bioinformatics studies to apply false discovery rate (FDR) correction methods like Benjamini-Hochberg to control for multiple testing issues.

This information can be collated into a table as follows:
