To answer your questions regarding the pathway enrichment analysis conducted in the scientific article, let's review the relevant sections:

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - The article mentions using "IPA" (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) as the bioinformatics analysis tool.

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**
   - No specific version number of IPA is mentioned in the text.

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**
   - The article does not specify which particular gene set libraries (like GO, KEGG, Reactome) were used within IPA for pathway enrichment analysis.

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - It is not explicitly stated whether a specific background gene list was defined in the text provided.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**
   - The article does not specify which statistical test was employed by IPA for enrichment analysis.

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - There is no mention of whether false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied in this study.

Here's a summary table based on the information available:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Tool used for pathway enrichment analysis | IPA |
| Tool version number provided | Not described |
| Gene set library queried | Not described |
| Background gene list defined | Not described |
