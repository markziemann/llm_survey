Here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis methods described in the provided text, presented in a table format.

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| 1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | KEGG |
| 2. Was a tool version number provided? | Not described |
| 3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)? | KEGG |
| 4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis? | Not described |
| 5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis? | Not described |
| 6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis? | Yes, false discovery rate correction was used. |

**Important Notes:**

*   The text explicitly states that KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed and FDR correction was applied.
*   However, the specific version of the KEGG tool used, details of the background gene list, and the particular statistical test employed are *not* detailed within the provided text. Therefore, those fields are marked as "Not described."
