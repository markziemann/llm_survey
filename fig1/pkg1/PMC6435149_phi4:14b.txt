To answer your questions about the pathway enrichment analysis conducted in this scientific article, let's examine the relevant sections:

1. **Tool Used for Pathway Enrichment Analysis:**
   - The article does not explicitly mention a specific tool used for pathway enrichment analysis.

2. **Tool Version Number Provided:**
   - Since no specific tool is mentioned, there is no version number provided.

3. **Gene Set Library Queried:**
   - The article mentions the use of "pathway analysis," but it does not specify which gene set library (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome) was queried.

4. **Background Gene List Defined for Pathway Enrichment Analysis:**
   - There is no detailed description provided about whether a background gene list was defined.

5. **Statistical Test Used for Enrichment Analysis:**
   - The article does not specify the statistical test used for enrichment analysis.

6. **False Discovery Rate Correction:**
   - It is not described whether false discovery rate correction was applied to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis.

In summary, many details regarding the methodology of the pathway enrichment analysis are not explicitly provided in the article. Here is a collated response:
