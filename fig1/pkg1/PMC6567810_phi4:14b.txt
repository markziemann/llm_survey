To extract information about pathway enrichment analysis from the provided article text, let's address each question separately:

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - The tools mentioned are miRBD, TargetScan, and miRWalk for predicting miRNA-target interactions.

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**
   - No specific version numbers were mentioned for the tools used in pathway enrichment analysis.

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**
   - The gene set libraries queried include GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes).

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - It is not explicitly described whether a specific background gene list was defined.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**
   - The text does not specify the exact statistical test used for enrichment analysis.

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - There is no description provided about whether a false discovery rate correction was applied.

Here's how this information can be collated into a table format:

| Question | Answer                        |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| 1. Tool(s) used for pathway enrichment analysis | miRBD, TargetScan, miRWalk   |
| 2. Tool version number provided            | Not described               |
| 3. Gene set library queried                | GO, KEGG                    |
| 4. Background gene list defined?           | Not described               |
| 5. Statistical test used                   | Not described               |
| 6. False discovery rate correction used    | Not described               |
