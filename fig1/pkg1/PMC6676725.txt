Abstract

   Protein interactions are crucial for maintaining homeostasis. Heat
   shock factor 1 (HSF1), a transcription factor that interacts with
   various proteins, is highly expressed in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
   of the cervix. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
   protein interaction profile of HSF1 in cervical SCC. Proteins
   interacting with HSF1 in SCC tissue and non-cancerous control (Ctrl)
   tissue were obtained by immunoprecipitation, separated by SDS-PAGE,
   identified by matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analyzed
   using bioinformatics methods. A total of 220 and 241 proteins were
   identified by mass spectrometry in the tissues of Ctrl and SCC samples,
   respectively, among which 172 were detected exclusively in SCC (Pro-S),
   151 exclusively in Ctrl (Pro-C) and 69 in both groups (Pro-B). The
   protein interaction profiles were different in each group; the STRING
   database identified three proteins that interacted with HSF1 directly,
   including insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and small nuclear
   RNA-activating protein complex subunit 4 in Pro-C and small
   ubiquitin-related modifier 1 in Pro-S. Functional enrichment analysis
   of Gene Ontology revealed that the top terms were alternative splicing
   in Pro-S and polymorphism in Pro-C. In Pro-S, more categories were
   related to protein modification, such as phosphorylation,
   ubiquitination and acetylation. Therefore, HSF1 may influence the
   occurrence and development of cervical SCC by interacting with specific
   proteins.

Introduction

   Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignant gynecological
   tumors, and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (SCC) is the most
   common histological subtype ([34]1). According to a 2015 report by the
   Chinese Cancer Registry, cervical cancer has an incidence rate of 9.89
   per 100,000 and a mortality rate of 2.6 per 100,000 ([35]2). Further
   clarification of the molecular mechanisms underlying cervical cancer
   may lead to the development of improved treatment options for this
   disease.

   Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) was first identified as a classical
   transcriptional factor activated in the heat shock response ([36]3).
   Upon activation by a variety of stimuli such as heat shock, infection
   and heavy metal toxicity, HSF1 forms trimers, translocates into the
   nucleus and induces various heat shock proteins (HSPs) by binding to
   heat shock elements (HSEs) on HSP promoters ([37]4,[38]5). Accumulating
   evidence has suggested that HSF1 is a powerful modifier of
   carcinogenesis; HSF1 levels are elevated in several cancers, including
   breast ([39]6), ovarian ([40]7) and cervical cancer ([41]8). Activated
   or elevated HSF1 is often associated with resistance to chemotherapy
   drugs or poor prognosis ([42]9). A previous study revealed that
   HSF1^−/− mice are resistant to chemically induced tumors, and that
   HSF1^−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts resist oncogene-induced
   transformation ([43]10). However, the underlying mechanisms of the
   resistance remain to be determined.

   Several studies have reported that HSF1 promotes a specific
   transcriptional program in highly malignant cells ([44]11), as well as
   distinct transcriptional programs in cancer-associated fibroblasts and
   adjacent cancer cells ([45]12). It is currently unknown why HSF1
   regulates the transcription of different genes under different
   conditions. HSF1 has been reported to interact with numerous protein
   factors and serves multiple roles in various physiological and
   pathological processes, such as nuclear factor of interleukin 6
   ([46]13), 14-3-3 epsilon ([47]14), heat shock transcription factor
   binding protein 1 ([48]15) and 26S subunit, non-ATPase 10/gankyrin
   ([49]16). Interactions with different proteins under various conditions
   may enable HSF1 to perform multiple functions. Therefore, clarifying
   the protein interaction profile of HSF1 in SCC may help identify the
   functions of HSF1.

   In the present study, proteins that bind to HSF1 in the cervical
   tissues of patients with SCC and control subjects were obtained by
   using immunoprecipitation (IP) and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel bands
   were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of
   flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to identify the proteins. Based
   on these results, interaction networks and potential molecular
   functions of the identified proteins were analyzed by bioinformatic
   methods.

Materials and methods

Patients and tissue samples

   Cervical tissue samples were collected from four patients diagnosed
   with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix, who underwent total
   hysterectomy, as well as four control (Ctrl) patients diagnosed with
   hysteromyoma or adenomyosis with unaffected cervical tissue in
   Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University (Zhanjiang, China)
   between February and August 2013 ([50]Table SI). All patients in the
   SCC group were not complicated with other types of pelvic cancer and
   did not receive chemoradiotherapy within 3 months before surgery.
   Disease staging was performed following the International Federation of
   Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification. In addition, two
   groups met three major criteria: i) Higher HSF1 expression in SCC
   compared to Ctrl; ii) matched for age in the two groups (43±2.94 years
   in SCC; 45.25±3.69 years in Ctrl); iii) similar clinical stage for SCC
   patients (three were in stage IIa and one in stage Ib2). The study was
   approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of
   Guangdong Medical University (Zhanjiang, China; reference no.
   PJ2013046) and written informed consent was obtained from all patients
   before surgery. Patients were not treated with chemotherapy or
   radiotherapy for 3 months prior to surgery.

Protein extraction

   Total protein from each sample (200 mg) was extracted in
   radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (EMD Millipore,
   Billerica, MA, USA) plus 0.01% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and
   protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Cell Signaling Technology,
   Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) in a homogenizer on ice, and insoluble debris
   was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,800 × g at 4°C. Protein
   concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay kit
   (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China).

IP and electrophoresis

   PureProteome protein G/A beads and a magnetic stand (EMD Millipore)
   were used to immunoprecipitate the proteins that bound to HSF1,
   following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 100 µl G/A beads were
   incubated with rabbit polyclonal HSF1 antibody (1:50, cat. no. ab2923;
   Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 25°C for 10 min with continuous mixing.
   Following washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.4), the
   immobilized capture antibody was incubated with pooled protein (500 µg,
   in equal amounts from 4 samples) at 4°C overnight with continuous
   mixing. The immunoprecipitates were washed with PBS containing 0.1%
   Tween 20 (pH 7.4), eluted by boiling in RIPA buffer and resolved by 10%
   SDS-PAGE.

Gel staining

   The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (0.1% R250,
   40% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid) at 25°C for 20 min and then
   washed 4 times with washing buffer (10% methanol, 10% glacial acetic
   acid) for 10 min each time. To avoid interference from heavy/light
   antibody chains in MS analysis, 10 pairs of bands distant from the
   antibody chains exhibiting differences between the SCC and Ctrl groups
   were cut from the gel.

In-gel digestion

   In-gel digestions were prepared as described by Ostling et al ([51]17).
   Briefly, gel sections were minced into 1 mm^3 pieces and washed 4 times
   with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (NH[4]HCO[3]) in 50% acetonitrile
   (ACN; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The gel fragments
   were subjected to reduction using 10 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich;
   Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) in 100 mM NH[4]HCO[3] buffer at 60°C
   for 1 h. Alkylation was performed in a solution of 55 mM iodoacetamide
   (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) in 100 mM NH[4]HCO[3] for 30 min at 25°C in
   the dark followed by in-gel digestion with 10 µl of trypsin (25 ng/µl;
   Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) in 50 mM NH[4]CO[3] at 37°C for
   14–16 h. Subsequently, the supernatant was transferred to a new
   microcentrifuge tube and 100 µl of 60% ACN containing 0.1%
   trifluoroacetic acid (TFA; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) was added to the
   remaining debris, which was then treated by sonication for 15 min to
   collect the supernatant at room temperature. The two parts of the
   supernatant were combined and vacuum-dried to a volume of 10 µl. The
   vacuum-dried supernatant was concentrated with a ZipTips^®C18 (EMD
   Millipore) and washed 3 times with 0.1% TFA. The samples were
   subsequently eluted with buffer (0.1% TFA and 50% ACN) and 1 µl
   α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (5 mg/ml) was added before spotting onto
   the target plate.

MALDI-TOF-MS

   Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) and sequence analysis were carried
   out on a MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (4800 Proteomics Analyzer;
   Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Internal standard
   calibration of the PMF spectra was performed using the autolysis
   products of trypsin. Peptide mass maps were acquired in positive
   reflection mode at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV and laser intensity
   of 6,000, averaging 1,200 laser shots per MALDI-TOF spectrum and 2,400
   shots per TOF/TOF spectrum (the resolution was 20,000). The top 10
   precursor ion mass peaks with a mass range of 800–4,000 Da were
   selected for tandem TOF/TOF analysis. Two analysis types, combined MS
   and MS/MS, were used to examine the human NCBInr
   ([52]ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nr.gz) and Swissprot
   ([53]ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowle
   dgebase/complete/)databases using Mascot software (version 2.2; Matrix
   Science Ltd.) to identify proteins that bind to HSF1. Searches were
   performed to allow for carbamidomethylation, oxidation and a maximum of
   one missed trypsin cleavage. Peptide tolerance and MS/MS tolerance were
   both 0.2 Da. Confidently identified proteins had a statistically
   significant protein score (P<0.05 based on combined MS and MS/MS
   spectra).

Bioinformatics analysis

   The interactions of MS-identified proteins from SCC and Ctrl samples
   were preliminarily confirmed using the STRING (version 10.5) online
   database ([54]https://string-db.org). Functional categories and the
   Gene Ontology (GO) terms biological process, cellular component and
   molecular function of MS-identified proteins were analyzed using the
   Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID
   6.8; [55]http://david.ncifcrf.gov).

Results

Proteins binding to HSF1

   In order to investigate the effect of HSF1, four SCC samples with
   higher HSF1 expression levels than the Ctrl samples were used in the
   current study ([56]Fig. S1). A total of 392 different proteins were
   identified by MS, with 241 and 220 proteins in SCC and Ctrl samples,
   respectively. The proteins were distributed as follows: 172 proteins
   only occurred in SCC (termed Pro-S), 151 proteins were identified only
   in Ctrl (termed Pro-C), and 69 proteins were identified in the two
   groups (termed Pro-B) and were removed from further analysis ([57]Table
   I). Furthermore, the immunoprecipitated proteins binding to HSF1
   yielded a different SDS-PAGE electropherogram ([58]Fig. S2).

Interaction analysis

   The STRING website was used to determine whether the proteins
   identified by MS bound to HSF1. A total of 151 proteins from the Pro-C
   set were entered along with HSF1, which produced a network consisting
   of 144 nodes and 61 edges. In this network, HSF1 was indicated to
   interact with insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and small nuclear
   RNA-activating protein complex subunit 4; these proteins interacted
   with others to form a highly complex network ([60]Fig. 1A).

   HSF1 and the 172 proteins from the Pro-S set were also entered, and a
   network consisting of 167 nodes and 92 edges was obtained. The results
   identified an interaction between HSF1 and small ubiquitin-related
   modifier 1 (SUMO1). Additionally, SUMO1 was indicated to interact with
   other proteins to construct a highly complicated network, which
   included neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated
   protein 8 (NEDD8), cullin-4B, receptor-interacting serine-threonine
   kinase 4 (RIPK4), and disheveled segment polarity protein 3 (DVL3) from
   the Pro-S set ([63]Fig. 1B).

Functional classification

   Subsequently, 151 proteins from the Pro-C set and 172 proteins from the
   Pro-S set were entered into DAVID bioinformatics resources. Two of
   these proteins, immunoglobulin heavy constant µ and caspase 5, were not
   recognized by the database and removed from further analysis.
   Therefore, 150 proteins from Pro-C and 171 proteins from Pro-S were
   subjected to functional classification according to the UniProtKB
   Keywords original database in DAVID. Following this analysis, 130/150
   proteins from Pro-C and 147/171 proteins from Pro-S were present in the
   output. The results revealed the distribution of Pro-S proteins into
   functional categories that differed from those of Pro-C ([64]Fig. 2).
   The predominant category in Pro-S was ‘alternative splicing’ (57.31%),
   whereas the largest category in Pro-C was ‘polymorphism’ (70.00%).
   ‘Phosphoprotein’ was the second largest category in both groups,
   representing 55.56% of proteins in Pro-S and 48.00% of proteins in
   Pro-C. The third largest category was related to cellular localization
   in both sets; however, this category was ‘nuclear localization’
   (31.58%) in Pro-S and ‘cytoplasmic localization’ (36.00%) in Pro-C.
   Furthermore, five categories were present in the two groups at
   comparable frequencies: ‘Coiled coil’, ‘ATP binding’, ‘nucleotide
   binding’, ‘cytoskeleton’ and ‘cilium’. A considerable fraction of the
   proteins indicated to bind HSF1 in Pro-S were associated with protein
   modifications, including ‘acetylation’ (22.81%), ‘ubiquitin-like (Ubl)
   conjugation’ (12.28%) and ‘Ubl conjugation pathway’ (7.02%).

GO term analysis

   The protein sets obtained for Pro-S and Pro-C were subjected to GO term
   analysis. For the cellular component category, 79/150 proteins in Pro-C
   and 82/171 proteins in Pro-S were identified. The results revealed that
   the proteins were mainly located in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm in
   Pro-C, whereas the proteins were in the cytosol, nucleoplasm and
   membrane in Pro-S ([67]Fig. 3A). For the molecular function category,
   49/150 proteins in Pro-C and 31/171 proteins in Pro-S were analyzed.
   The largest category was ‘ATP binding’ in the two sets and the category
   ‘poly (A) RNA binding’ also has large proportion in Pro-C ([68]Fig.
   3B). For the biological process category, 39/150 proteins in Pro-C and
   51/171 proteins in Pro-S were analyzed. The largest two categories were
   ‘protein phosphorylation’ and ‘negative regulation of the canonical Wnt
   signaling pathway’ in Pro-S, and ‘translation’ and ‘positive regulation
   of apoptotic process’ in Pro-C ([69]Fig. 3C).

Discussion

HSF1 may bind to distinct proteins in SCC

   Tumorigenesis is a complex process involving various protein factors
   and molecular pathways. HSF1 is a transcription factor involved in
   multiple diseases through interactions with numerous proteins,
   including nuclear factor-interleukin-6 and 14-3-3ε ([72]14,[73]18).
   This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to examine the
   function of HSF1 at the interactional proteome level in SCC. Clear
   differences in the proteins that bind to HSF1 were observed between
   cervical SCC tissue and Ctrl tissue, which indicated that the proteins
   binding to HSF1 were distinct in the two tissue types.

HSF1 may participate in alternative splicing in SCC

   The proteins identified by MS as only present in SCC or Ctrl tissues
   were classified using the online functional annotation tool DAVID. The
   largest category of proteins binding to HSF1 in Pro-S were involved in
   alternative splicing. Alternative splicing enables the production of
   different combinations of exons from the same genomic template and
   therefore increases protein complexity ([74]19). In cervical cancer,
   alternative splicing of numerous genes, including Numb ([75]20),
   survivin Dex3 ([76]21) and RAB1B, member RAS oncogene family ([77]22),
   has been reported. Additionally, the serine/arginine rich family of
   proteins dictate splice site recognition ([78]23). HSF1 is a
   serine-rich protein ([79]24), which suggests that HSF1 may interact
   with certain proteins to participate in alternative splicing of genes
   in SCC. However, the association between HSF1, alternative splicing and
   cervical cancer has not been widely examined.

HSF1 may have unique phosphorylation in SCC

   Phosphoproteins was the second largest category in Pro-C and Pro-S.
   HSF1 is a serine-rich constitutively phosphorylated mediator of the
   stress response ([80]24) and can be phosphorylated at multiple sites,
   including Ser230 ([81]25), Ser303 and Ser307 ([82]26). The inducible
   phosphorylation of HSF1 is correlated with its transcriptional
   activation ([83]27). piR-823 may influence whether HSF1 phosphorylation
   functions as a tumor promoter ([84]28). Therefore, HSF1 phosphorylation
   status may serve a role in the genesis and progression of cervical
   cancer. Among the phosphoproteins in Pro-S, two common kinases were
   detected: RIPK4 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase
   kinase 3 (MAP4K3; [85]Table I). RIPK4 functions as a node in the
   protein network for the Pro-S set. Increased RIPK4 expression is
   associated with the progression and favorable prognosis of cervical
   cancer ([86]29); RIPK4 promotes canonical Wnt signaling by
   phosphorylating disheveled segment polarity protein 2 ([87]30). HSF1
   Ser326 is a substrate of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases
   ([88]31). These data suggested that distinct kinases may be activated
   and interact with HSF1 in cervical cancer.

   SUMO1 was identified in the ‘alternative splicing’ and
   ‘phosphoproteins’ categories (data not shown) and was confirmed by
   String to interact with HSF1. SUMO1 was demonstrated to regulate HSF1
   DNA-binding activity through sumoylation at Lys298 ([89]32). No
   previously published studies have investigated the correlation of
   SUMO1, HSF1 and cervical cancer. Therefore, whether the interaction
   between SOMU1 and HSF1 is involved in the occurrence and development of
   cervical cancer deserves attention.

HSF1 may exhibit greater translocation into the nucleus in SCC

   The third largest functional category was ‘nucleus’ in Pro-S and
   ‘cytoplasm’ in Pro-C. Although GO cellular component analysis revealed
   that the cytoplasm was the largest and nucleoplasm the second largest
   term in both Pro-S and Pro-C, the ratio of protein in the nucleoplasm
   vs. cytoplasm was higher in Pro-S (0.87) compared with in Pro-C (0.64).
   HSF1 is activated and translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus
   under stress conditions ([90]4). The results of the present study
   indicated that more HSF1 translocated to the nucleus in cervical SCC
   compared with normal tissue. Therefore, blocking the translocation of
   HSF1 during malignant transformation, for example, in human papilloma
   virus infection, may represent a therapeutic strategy.

   In the molecular function GO analysis, ‘ATP binding’ was the largest
   category in Pro-C and Pro-S. In this category, dynein light
   intermediate chain 1 (DYNC1LI1) was identified in ATP binding and
   nucleotide binding categories (data not shown). DYNC1LI1 is a
   transporter in eukaryotic cells that serves important roles in the
   development and function of the mammalian nervous system ([91]33) and
   malignancy of glioma ([92]34). HSF1 has been reported to reinforce cell
   death resistance in glioma ([93]35). The translocation of HSF1 under
   stress is not well-understood; further studies of the role of DYNC1LI1
   in SCC may clarify the mechanism of HSF1 translocation.

HSF1 may influence acetylation in SCC

   The fourth largest functional category in the Pro-S group was
   acetylation. Acetylation introduces an acetyl functional group into a
   chemical compound, which is an important modification of proteins at
   co-translational and post-translational level. Studies of histone
   acetylation in cervical cancer have revealed that histone H3 acetyl K9
   was correlated with low grading and low FIGO staging scores ([94]36).
   Col et al reported that HSF1 regulates the acetylation of pericentric
   chromatin such as histone H3K9 or H3K4 under heat stress ([95]37).
   These data suggested that HSF1 may promote the development of cervical
   cancer by influencing the acetylation of H3K9.

HSF1 may bind to a distinct ubiquitin protein ligase in SCC

   The fifth largest functional category in the Pro-S group was ‘coiled
   coil’. Coiled coil is a structural motif in proteins in which 2–7
   a-helices are coiled together resembling strands of a rope ([96]38). In
   the present study, two coiled-coil proteins were identified in the same
   E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family: HECT, C2 and WW domain-containing
   E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (HECW) 1 and HECW2; HECW1 was identified in
   Pro-C and HECW2 was identified in Pro-S ([97]Table I). HECW1 interacts
   with RNF43 to enhance pro-apoptotic activity through p53 ([98]39).
   HECW2 enhances endothelial cell-to-cell junctions, and its deficiency
   impairs angiogenesis ([99]40). This suggested that HSF1 may interact
   with different members of the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family under
   pathological and normal conditions.

HSF1 and Wnt signaling pathway

   Although the Wnt signaling pathway appeared very low in the functional
   categories (2.92%, [100]Fig. 2B), the biological process related to Wnt
   signaling pathway appeared four times in GO analysis for Pro-S
   ([101]Fig. 3C b). The reason may be there were fewer members of this
   pathway. Wnt signaling pathway is involved in the development and
   metastasis of cervical cancer ([102]41,[103]42). HSF1 increases
   Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation ([104]43), which suggested that HSF1
   may be involved in the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer by regulating
   the Wnt signaling pathway. Interestingly, in the present study, the
   biological processes included not only positive but also negative
   regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway. It is possible that HSF1
   may increase Wnt pathway activation indirectly by antagonizing the
   effect of a protein which can negative regulate the Wnt signaling
   pathway. The biological process of ‘negative regulation of the
   canonical Wnt signaling pathway’ included six proteins: Proteasome
   subunit β (PSMB) 10; nephrocystin 3; DVL3; low-density lipoprotein
   receptor-related protein 4; PSMB3; and the proteasome 26S subunit,
   ATPase 3 (PSMC3) (data not shown). Among these proteins, PSMB10, PSMB3,
   PSMC3 and DVL3 formed a quadrilateral network as part of a larger
   network with HSF1 through NEDD8 and SUMO1 ([105]Fig. 1B). Further
   studies are needed to explore whether HSF1 is able to regulate the Wnt
   signaling pathway by binding to this protein.

   Although SUMO1 was the only protein identified in Pro-S and interacting
   with HSF1 directly ([106]Fig. 1B), the results of the present study
   indicated possible indirect interactions between HSF1 and numerous
   proteins in the context of cervical cancer. The current study provided
   insight into the mechanism by which HSF1 influences the development of
   cervical cancers. However, owing to its preliminary nature, the study
   has some deficiencies such as small sample size and incomprehensive
   selection of reagents. For example, the RIPA buffer may disrupt weak
   non-covalent protein-protein interactions. In addition, we only chose
   10 paired bands with obvious difference for MS. All these may possibly
   result in certain proteins, which have been reported as interactional
   proteins of HSF1, not being identified. Thus, future studies need to be
   conducted to confirm these interactions and to explore their functions
   in cervical SCC.
