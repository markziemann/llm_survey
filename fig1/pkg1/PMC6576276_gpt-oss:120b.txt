Thinking...
We need to answer 6 questions based on the article excerpt. The excerpt includes only abstract and some methods summary. It mentions "Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was applied to recognise gene pathways associated with vitamin A supplementation." So tool: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Any other? No other enrichment tool mentioned. Version not described. Gene set libraries: IPA uses its own curated knowledge base; not specifically named like GO, KEGG. Not described. Custom background: Not described. Statistical test used in enrichment analysis: Not described; IPA uses Fisher's exact test usually, but not mentioned. So answer: Not described. Multiple testing correction: Not described.

We need to output table format. Provide rows for each question? Probably columns: Question, Answer. Provide succinct.

Let's produce.

...done thinking.
