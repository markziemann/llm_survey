Here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis methods described in the provided text, formatted for a table as requested.

**1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**

DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery)

**2. Was a tool version number provided?**

Yes, the authors provided the version number: DAVID web server ([140]Huang da et al., 2009).

**3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**

Both GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) were used.

**4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**

Not described. The text does not explicitly state whether a background gene list was used or how it was defined.

**5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**

Not described. The text mentions the use of DAVID but does not specify the particular statistical test employed for the enrichment analysis within the tool.

**6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**

Not described. The methods section does not mention whether or not false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to the results.
