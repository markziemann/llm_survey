Abstract

   Background: Breast cancer is the most frequent and one of the most
   fatal malignancies among women. Within the concept of personalized
   medicine, molecular characterization of tumors is usually performed by
   analyzing somatic mutations, RNA gene expression signatures or the
   proteome by mass-spectrometry. Alternatively, the immunological
   fingerprint of the patients can be analyzed by protein microarrays,
   which is able to provide another layer of molecular pathological
   information without invasive intervention.

   Results: We have investigated the immune signature of breast cancer
   patients and compared them with healthy controls, using protein
   microarray-based IgG profiling. The identified differentially reactive
   antigens (n=517) were further evaluated by means of various pathway
   analysis tools. Our results indicate that the immune signature of
   breast cancer patients shows a clear distinction from healthy
   individuals characterized by differentially reactive antigens involved
   in known disease relevant signaling pathways, such as VEGF,
   AKT/PI3K/mTOR or c-KIT, which is in close agreement with the findings
   from RNA-based expression profiles.

   Conclusion: Differential antigenic properties between breast cancer
   patients and healthy individual classes can be defined by serum-IgG
   profiling on protein microarrays. These immunome profiles provide an
   additional layer of molecular pathological information, which has the
   potential to refine and complete the systems biological map of
   neoplastic disease.

INTRODUCTION

   In recent decades great efforts have been made to reduce the incidences
   of breast cancer, which increases each year. External and internal risk
   factors, such as the ever-increasing environmental burden, inadequate
   lifestyles- or dietary habits, are thought to aggravate the current
   situation [[35]1] and might eventually lead to somatic changes. With
   the advent of new diagnostic tools, such as ultrasound, magnetic
   resonance imaging and mammography screenings mortality rates have been
   slightly reduced [[36]2]. Nevertheless, the low sensitivity or
   specificity of such techniques results in detection of breast cancer
   often at an advanced stage. Hence, there is an important need to
   develop new tools that would allow for early cancer detection and are
   less invasive (e.g. avoid unnecessary biopsies, irradiation by
   mammography). This is especially important when clinicians try to
   discriminate between malignant breast cancer and benign breast lesions.
   An ideal solution would be to identify cancer specific biomarkers from
   body fluids, such as blood, urine or saliva. Genomic and proteomic
   approaches including altered DNA methylation- or microRNA patterns or
   specific protein signatures could provide solutions for these
   requirements. Another option would be to detect tumor-associated
   antibodies specific to tumor antigens of patients, before (through
   screening regimes) or early at the onset of cancer development [[37]3].

   Cancer related antigens were first recognized in the 1950’s based on
   observations from chemically induced carcinomas in mice [[38]4, [39]5,
   [40]6]. Ever since tumor-associated antigens have been reported in a
   variety of cancer entities, such as breast-, ovarian-, prostate- or
   colon cancer [[41]7, [42]8, [43]9]. The immunogenicity of
   tumor-associated antigens has been attributed to aberrantly expressed
   proteins, which could derive from mutations, altered
   post-transcriptional or translational modifications, abnormal cellular
   localizations or deregulated apoptotic/necrotic processes [[44]10,
   [45]11, [46]12]. From a diagnostic point of view, only one such an
   antigen is insufficient to discriminate between cases and controls
   because of lack of sensitivity and specificity, thus multiple antigens
   have to be used simultaneously. Distinction has to be made as well when
   classifying antigens whether those are common among most cancers or
   specific to only one type. As an example, damage-associated molecular
   patterns (DAMPs) are frequently associated with cancer, chronic
   inflammation and necrosis [[47]13, [48]14, [49]15]. Therefore
   molecules, such as HSP90, HMGB1, S100 and mitochondrial DNA are
   frequently detected in diverse cancer-related diagnostic studies
   [[50]16, [51]17, [52]18]. Finding a tumor specific autoantibody
   signature is even more complicated since there are large variations
   between patients in general. Breast cancer is also not an exception and
   it is largely heterogeneous in terms of structural-, molecular-,
   genomic-, intratumoral- and micro-environmental variations [[53]19].
   Inflammatory cells, endothelial cell, pericytes, tumor-associated
   fibroblasts, cancer cells and constituents of extracellular matrix can
   all display large diversity of antigens on their surface or upon
   disintegration. The situation becomes even more complex with cancer
   progression because of accumulating genetic and epigenetic alternations
   within cancer cells (e.g. increasing aneuploidy), yielding vast amount
   of aberrantly expressed proteins. Furthermore, along the course of
   tumor development/progression the temporal changes of immune competence
   (i.e. immune evasions) could alter the composition of tumor-associated
   antibodies.

   In this study, we have investigated the circulating antibody (IgG)
   signature of non-hereditary breast cancer patients and compared them
   with healthy controls, using protein microarray analyses. The aim of
   this discovery-phase study was to identify breast cancer-associated
   antigens in order to use them as a potential tool for diagnostics in
   the future. We asked whether the circulating IgG antibody repertoire of
   breast cancer patients could reflect spectra of antigens and the
   biological phenomena they are involved in. Our results indicate that
   the immune signatures of breast cancer patients show a clear
   distinction from healthy individuals characterized by the biological
   pathways in which the corresponding antigens are participate.

RESULTS

Differentially reactive antigen data shows similarities with expression
profiles of breast cancer

   Seventy-seven IgG samples from non-hereditary breast cancer patients
   were screened on 16K protein microarray and compared with 62 IgG
   samples from healthy controls. The clinico-pathological data of study
   samples are shown in [54]Table 1. The list of differentially reactive
   antigenic proteins consists of 516 entries, where 305 antigens were
   “upregulated” in cancer and 211 antigens reactivity were decreased
   ([55]Supplementary Table 1).

   Having the analyzed IgG samples from sporadic breast cancer patients we
   scanned the COSMIC database to find concordance with protein entries
   associated with somatic alternations in breast cancer. Out of the 516
   antigens 34 proteins were found ([57]Supplementary Table 1) amongst the
   so-called COSMIC-census genes (n=572, at the time of the study), which
   considered the most important cancer genes (proteins) with somatic (or
   both somatic and germ-line) mutations. Meta-analysis also shows the
   percentage of breast cancer cases (in COSMIC database; n=883 samples)
   in which the given gene was up- or down regulated; or copy number
   variation was detected (n=761 samples) ([58]Supplementary Table 1).

   Furthermore, we have checked the overlap between various differentially
   expressed gene sets and our dataset using GSEA/MSig database,
   oncogenic- and immunologic signature option. Among the most significant
   overlaps we found up-regulated gene sets in MCF-7 breast cancer-, and
   MCF-10 mammary epithelium cell lines, where CCND1, MAP2K1 or EIF4G
   genes were over-expressed/knockdown, respectively ([59]Table 2).
   Regarding the immunologic signature overlap the most significant gene
   set was that in which the effects of diabetes were measured on
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells. According to certain studies there
   is an association between diabetes and the risk of cancer development
   and outcome [[60]20, [61]21].

Inferring signaling pathways from differentially reactive antigens

   Ingenuity Global Canonical Pathways were assessed and the top 15 most
   significant pathways were plotted with the ratio of enrichment
   ([63]Figure 1A). [64]Supplementary Table 2A shows Ingenuity Canonical
   Pathway analyses results, threshold set at p<0.05. The top canonical
   pathways found are related to various immunological- and inflammatory
   processes, and to cancer. The most significant (p=4.17E-05) canonical
   pathway is the Fcγ Receptor-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages and
   monocytes. The major function of these receptors is to bind monomeric
   or aggregated IgG molecules, immune complexes or opsonized particles
   [[65]22]. Upon receptor binding internalization of the complex is
   initiated with cup formation and subsequent phagosome development,
   which may finally lead to antigen presentation via activating or
   inhibitory pathways. These antigens could derive from the cellular
   constituents of dying macrophages, which are recruited to the sites of
   tumor, through various “danger signals” (e.g. HSP90 and HMGB2;
   upregulated in cancer in this dataset; [66]Supplementary Table 1)
   [[67]13] derived from the tumor itself. High numbers of resident or
   recruited macrophages at tumor sites are associated with elevated
   inflammation and poor outcome. Specifically, the found proteins are
   associated with actin cytoskeleton characteristic to phagocytosis.
   Tumor-associated macrophage functions are also related to VEGF-
   (p=1.02E-03), PTEN-(p=6.61E-03) and mTOR- (p=2.14E-02) signaling
   pathways, which are common examples for cancer related processes
   including tumor angiogenesis. In summary, most of the found Ingenuity
   canonical pathways are associated with the components of the
   PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway, which signaling cascade is estimated to be
   deregulated by gene mutations in more than 70% of all breast cancer
   [[68]23]. Yet worth to mention, the canonical pathway CTLA-4 Signaling
   in Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes is also highly significant (p= 5.75E-04)
   through Ingenuity. Although the CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T
   lymphocyte-associated antigen-4) protein itself is not among the
   differentially reactive antigens in our dataset the corresponding
   pathway serves as a good example on how an immune process counteracts
   with cancer [[69]24]. Of note, another immune-checkpoint molecule LAG-3
   (Lymphocyte activation gene-3) is found to be differentially antigenic
   and upregulated in the cancer group.

   reactive antigens. Minus-log10 p-values (bars) and enrichment ratios
   (line) are shown. (B) Deduced molecular pathways using PathwayCommons
   tool. Red bar indicates increased-, blue bar decreased antigen binding
   reactivity.

   Complementing the above results from other aspects we have analyzed our
   dataset by Pathway Commons as well, using Webgestalt integrated
   gene-set enrichment tool kit. [72]Figure 1B shows the top 10 identified
   pathways in PathwayCommons analyses ([73]Supplementary Table 2B). The
   highest numbers of antigens, 77 proteins, was associated with Beta1
   integrin cell surface interactions (p= 0.0018). In the context of
   mammary gland development Beta1-integrins are essential for luminal
   polarity and myoepithelial contraction [[74]25, [75]26]. Consequently,
   deregulated expression of integrins results in altered tissue
   architecture and metastasis of breast cancer [[76]27, [77]28, [78]29].
   In order to validate and visualize molecular associations (within this
   category) we have ran protein-protein interaction analysis (String
   Database). The 77 mapped proteins are predicted to interact with each
   other with high significance giving 178 observed interactions
   (p=6,11E-15) ([79]Figure 2A). One of the central nodes is AKT1 with
   TSC2 and RAF1 axis; the other core is LCK (lymphocyte-specific
   protein-tyrosine kinase) with STAT signaling. LCK is a non-receptor
   protein-tyrosine kinase and has a fundamental role in T-cell receptor
   mediated signaling, thus thymocyte development and T-cell activation
   [[80]30].

   (A) Deduced molecular associations related to integrin-mediated
   interactions, based on PathwayCommons analysis. (B) Deduced molecular
   associations related to LKB1-mediated interactions. Disconnected nodes
   are not shown. Major core molecules are highlighted with black;
   differences between integrin- and LKB-1 related networks (B) are
   highlighted with orange.

   Yet another highly represented (75 proteins) pathway is the LKB1
   mediated signaling (p=0,0021) ([83]Figure 1B). The Liver Kinase B1
   (LKB1) gene product is a serine/threonine kinase and has pleiotropic
   functions in cell growth, epithelial polarity and energy metabolism
   [[84]31]. LKB1 is also considered as tumor suppressor that is lost in
   several cancer types [[85]32] including breast cancer [[86]33], and it
   is able to act through several signaling cascades, such as mTOR, AMPK
   (5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) or PI3K/AKT
   [[87]34]. Analyzing the molecular associations (String database),
   composition of the involved molecules in the core part of this network
   is very similar to the integrin signaling associated molecules
   mentioned above (only 6 molecules are different), resulting in a
   slightly higher number of interacting proteins (n=181, p=1.55E-15)
   ([88]Figure 2B, [89]Supplementary Table 2B). One unique protein within
   LKB1 pathway is Ezrin (EZR), which has been shown to mediate breast
   cancer cell migration, hence facilitating metastasis [[90]35].

   Regarding both Beta1-integrin mediated interactions and LKB1mediated
   signaling in breast cancer the CYLD (cylindromatosis) protein is of
   paramount importance too, which act as a deubiquitinating enzyme and is
   considered as a tumor suppressor [[91]36, [92]37].

   In the PathwayCommons analysis the signaling pathway with the highest
   significance (p= 9.68E-06) was the Kit-receptor mediated signaling. One
   of the interesting upregulated protein within this pathway is CISH
   (Cytokin-Inducible SH2-Containing Protein), which have been found as a
   key suppressor of IL15 and JAK signaling [[93]38].

   The KEGG pathway analyses ([94]Figure 3A; p<0,0025) resulted in a
   similar profile of functions to that of Ingenuity, i.e. enrichment of
   proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements during phagocytosis,
   VEGF- and proteasome pathways and immune cell functions. One of the
   exceptions from the similarities would be the RNA transport associated
   event. Molecules within these functions are involved in cytoplasmic
   transport of RNA, ribosomal binding of RNAs, pre-mRNA splicing,
   nucleopore complex formation and translation initiation and elongation.
   The KEGG analysis found 17 RNA transport associated molecules
   ([95]Supplementary Table 2C) and 27 interactions were predicted by
   String with high significance (p=8.88e-16, [96]Supplementary Figure 1).

   Purple/blue bars represent the number of related reactions/all
   reactions in category; yellow line shows -(log10) p-values.

   The top 20 terms of Reactome analysis (p≤2.12E-04; FDR≤0,012;
   [99]Supplementary Table 2D) reinforce some of the findings by
   Ingenuity, Pathway Commons or KEGG analysis: VEGF-, Kit-, TCR- and MAPK
   signaling ([100]Figure 3B). The top ranked term “Regulation of mRNA
   stability by proteins that binds AU-rich element” (p-value=1,7E-7;
   FDR=2,05E-4) shows also consensus with the PathwayCommons result
   (“Destabilization of mRNA by AUF1 (hnRNP D0)”). In this process AU rich
   binding protein (AUF1) dimers bind to adenyl-uridyl-rich elements (ARE)
   elements of certain mRNAs’ UTR, recruiting additional proteins, such as
   Poly-A binding protein, heat-shock proteins, translation initiation
   factor eIF4G, which finally may lead to mRNA degradation [[101]39].

   Another important category regarding breast cancer is “Transcriptional
   regulation by the AP-2 (TFAP2) family of transcription factors”. The
   family members of AP-2 regulate the cell growth and differentiation of
   tissues of ectodermal origin and involved in the regulation c-erbB-2
   (HER2) in breast cancer [[102]40, [103]41].

   We also wanted to find enriched protein domains that are preferentially
   recognized by the IgG pool of breast cancer patients. Therefore,
   InterPro functional classification was performed using all proteins
   (Cancer vs. Ctrl) with changed immune-reactivity ([104]Figure 4.).
   Ninety-eight proteins showed significantly enriched protein domains
   (p<0.05). We found that the protein domain with the highest relevance
   (p= 6.40E-04) was Immunoglobulin E-set domain, and the most abundant
   domains were P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (n=19;
   p=2.19E-2) and RNA recognition motif domain (n=12; p=1.45E-2).
   Importantly, Protein kinase-like domains, which also include the
   protein kinase domain subgroup, are also enriched (p= 1.82E-02) in our
   dataset. Proteins with these domains are highly conserved and have
   fundamental role in cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation
   [[105]42].

proteins using InterPro database.

   Finally, we analyzed whether the protein data set was enriched at
   certain chromosomal locations, i.e. to find possible foci that could be
   mutational hotspots/targeted by overexpressed or mutated proteins.
   According to GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) we have found 4
   enriched genomic regions: Chr3p21 (14 genes, p=2.36E-06); Chr19q13 (27
   genes, p=9.21E-06); Chr19p13 (20 genes, p=4.15E-05) and Chr1p36 (15
   genes, p=5.63E-04). ([108]Figure 5A; [109]Supplementary Table 3).

   reactive proteins, based on String database. Only connected nodes are
   shown as bubbles.

   In summary, 502 of 516 differentially reactive protein entries were
   mapped using String database. These proteins are predicted to be
   involved in 1968 interactions with each other (p=9.77E-14) ([112]Figure
   5B.). It also suggests that the differentially reactive antigenic
   protein based immune profiles of breast cancer patients are able to
   elucidate protein associations/complexes too, and could directly
   reflect the underlying signaling pathways accompanied with breast
   cancer development.

DISCUSSION

   In this discovery-study, we have used high-throughput protein
   microarray to identify altered immune-reactivity based on breast cancer
   patients’ IgG profile. Recognizing immune-phenotypes by different
   patient groups not only helps to develop tools for early-stage breast
   cancer detection, but also allow to get insight into molecular pathways
   and to devise potential new targets.

   Breast cancer, as other tumor types, is not only heterogeneous by means
   of patients but also consists of different cell types in the tumor
   microenvironment. Inflammatory cells, endothelial cell, pericytes,
   tumor-associated fibroblasts, cancer cells and constituents of
   extracellular matrix can all display large diversity of antigens on
   their cell-surface or upon disintegration. The situation becomes even
   more complex with cancer progression because of accumulating genetic
   and epigenetic alterations within cancer cells (e.g. increasing
   aneuploidy), yielding vast amount of aberrantly expressed proteins.
   Providing that the immune system can recognize these tumor-associated
   antigens as “non-self”, elimination of cancer cells may occur by
   cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells, as the best scenario.
   Unfortunately, through the so-called immune editing mechanism
   [[113]43], cancer cells are capable of escaping from detection and
   destruction. Looking at the comparison of IgG profile between the
   cancer and control group, we could see signs of both escape and
   elimination events. Related to this the CTLA-4 mediated signaling in
   CTLs refers to the negative regulation of T-cell function [[114]24],
   which is clearly unfavorable in the case of cancer. Known as the
   earliest identified immune-checkpoint molecule, blocking CTLA-4 binding
   to its ligand with monoclonal antibodies has been recently approved by
   FDA in melanoma therapy [[115]44]. Similarly to CTLA-4, LAG-3 also
   belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and negatively regulates T
   cell function. Since the administration of anti-LAG-3 antibodies were
   shown to inhibit Treg mediated immune suppression [[116]45, [117]46]
   LAG-3 has become an attractive new target for immune-therapy.

   Analyses revealed differentially reactive proteins involved in tumor
   angiogenesis (i.e. VEGF) as well, which is considered as an important
   hallmark of cancer [[118]35]. Both tumor cells and immune-inflammatory
   cells (e.g. macrophages) are capable to emit vascular endothelial
   growth factor that can induce tumor-promoting angiogenesis. Moreover,
   matrix-bound latent VEGF ligand can be released by proteases
   responsible for degrading extracellular matrix [[119]47]. Furthermore,
   mTOR and PTEN pathways are identified. Those are strongly associated
   with the AKT/PI3P signal transduction circuitry and frequently
   overexpressed (mTOR) or inactivated (PTEN) in a variety of cancer,
   including breast cancer [[120]48, [121]49].

   The presence of immune inflammatory cells at tumor sites is now a
   hallmark of cancer development [[122]35]. The enhanced macrophage
   activity may refer to an increased clearance of apoptotic/necrotic
   cells or cell-debris but could also mean increased number of
   tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). These macrophages facilitate
   angiogenesis and matrix remodeling, and eventually promote tumor growth
   and metastasis as they have been found to be associated with poor
   prognosis in several cancer entities [[123]50]. Increased levels of
   interleukin signaling (p= 7.41E-03) and leukocyte extravasation (p=
   3.98E-03) from our dataset ([124]Supplementary Table 2A) are also an
   indication of inflammatory situations; however, it is difficult to make
   conclusions how the tumor antagonizing or tumor promoting events take
   place.

   One of the highly represented (75 entries) pathway involves LKB1
   mediated signaling (p=0,0021, [125]Figure 1B). Concerning the function
   in epithelial polarity LKB1 is involved in the mechanism of contact
   inhibition since suppression of its expression destabilize epithelial
   integrity and the cell became susceptible to Myc-induced transformation
   [[126]35, [127]51, [128]52]. Analysis of the molecular association
   composition identified Ezrin (EZR) as a unique protein within LKB1
   pathway ([129]Figure 2B). The actin microfilament-associated EZR is a
   key regulator of Src activity [[130]53, [131]54, [132]55] and has
   important function in tumor induced angio-/lymph angiogenesis
   [[133]56].

   Also, CYLD protein was identified both in Beta1-integrin mediated
   interactions and LKB1 mediated signaling in breast cancer samples. Main
   function of CYLD is to negatively regulate TNFR-mediated activation of
   NF-kappa-B signaling, and thus modulates inflammation. Additionally, it
   can affect cell division/proliferation through signaling pathways, such
   as Akt, MAPK or Wnt/Beta-Catenin [[134]36]. Loss of CYLD up-regulates
   NFKB signaling and enhance metastasis in breast cancer [[135]37].

   Pathway Commons analysis identified the Kit-receptor mediated signaling
   pathways with the highest significance (p=9.68E-06). The c-Kit receptor
   is also a member of receptor tyrosine-kinase family, which upon binding
   with its ligand stem cell factor (SCF) could regulate apoptosis,
   proliferation, differentiation, and cell-motility in a variety of blood
   cells (red blood cell, T-cells, mast-cells). It has also important
   function in melanin- and gamete- formation, and Cajal-cells function of
   the gastrointestinal tract [[136]57, [137]58]. Moreover, c-Kit
   over-expression was frequently found in triple negative breast cancer
   although its precise role in breast cancer development is still
   uncovered [[138]59].

   Yet another signaling cascade that is not discussed so far but also
   identified by the PathwayCommons test is the Aurora-A pathway
   ([139]Figure 1B). It has been shown that Aurora-A is necessary for
   mitotic entry and centrosome separation, and is frequently
   overexpressed in various cancer types, including breast cancer, but not
   in benign breast lesions [[140]60]. Mice carrying an MMTV-Aurora-A
   transgene activate the AKT/mTOR signaling pathways (with high level of
   CCND1) and are characterized by centrosome amplification, chromosome
   tetraploidization and premature sister chromatid segregation in the
   affected cells [[141]61]. In addition to its oncogenic activity, Aurora
   A has been described as a tumor suppressor as well, which in turn has
   complicated recent efforts to develop inhibitors against this
   pleiotropic protein [[142]62].

   Taking together the results derived from the comparison of the IgG
   profile of breast carcinomas and control samples, it was found that
   those mostly related to the AKT/PI3K/mTOR pathway together with PTEN,
   complemented with c-Kit and Aurora A-signaling. These are then driving
   deregulated/changed integrin-, LKB1-and VEGF signaling that might lead
   to impaired cell-adhesion, contact inhibition and vascularization. The
   high prevalence of infiltrating immune cells might be indicative of an
   inflammatory situation during which crosstalk between leukocytes and
   cancer cells shaping the immune response. Also, the high degree of
   predicted protein-protein interactions shows the complexity of the
   underlying molecular pathways and the interconnection of signaling
   circuits.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Clinical/Study samples

   Samples were stored at -80°C until further utilization on protein
   microarray.

   A total of 139 blood samples were collected, 77 of which were collected
   from patients with breast cancer: invasive ductal carcinoma (n=53),
   invasive lobular carcinoma (n=7), non-invasive intraductal carcinoma
   (n=14) and unknown type (n=3). Sixty-two blood samples were collected
   from healthy volunteers with no individual or familial history of
   breast or ovarian cancer. Detailed clinical data can be found as
   [143]Supplementary Table 4.

16k protein microarray generation and processing

   The in-house printed 16k protein microarray comprised of 6369 distinct
   proteins from which 5449 have been annotated with a gene-symbol. The
   recombinant proteins (each represented by 2 to 3 clones) derived from
   the UniPex expression libraries (human fetal brain, T-cell, lung- and
   colon expression libraries), developed at the former RZPD (Deutsche
   Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung), Berlin. Detailed description of
   the 16K protein microarray generation can be found in earlier report
   [[144]63, [145]64, [146]65].

   The protein array platform, the technical procedures for sample- and
   array processing and the application and advantages of purified IgG
   over raw serum or plasma samples were described previously [[147]63,
   [148]66, [149]67]. Briefly, IgG purification of all serum samples was
   performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the
   Melon^TM Gel IgG Purification Spin Plate Kit (Thermo Scientific,
   Waltham, MA, USA). Quantifications of IgG samples were performed using
   the Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments, Winooski,
   VT, USA) to ensure their application on the microarrays at the same
   concentration (0.3 mg/mL). Integrity of the IgG samples were checked
   using SDS-PAGE on pre-casted NuPAGE^® Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Life
   Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

   Protein microarray slides were blocked with DIG Easy Hyb solution
   (Roche, Basel, Swiss). Purified IgG was diluted to 0.3 mg/mL in two
   steps: first Melon^TM Gel Purification Buffer (Thermo Scientific) to
   normalized concentration of 0.6 mg/mL IgG and then 1:1 with 2x PBS with
   0.2% Triton X-100 and 6% milk powder. The arrays were incubated for 4 h
   with constant rotation (12 rpm) at room temperature in a microarray
   hybridization oven (Agilent). After hybridization the slides were
   washed three times with PBSTx for 5 min, then incubated for 1 h with
   Alexa Fluor^® 647 goat anti-human IgG detection antibody (Invitrogen,
   Life Technologies). Slides were scanned using 10 µm resolution and 70%
   PMT to acquire array images.

Data acquisition and statistical analyses

   The scanned array images were imported into the GenePix Pro Microarray
   Acquisition & Analysis Software 6.0 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA,
   USA) and the resulting fluorescence intensities of all features were
   calculated. The local background was subtracted from the median values
   before statistical data analysis, which was performed using R 2.10.0
   and BRB-Array Tools 4.2.1
   ([150]https://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html) [[151]68]. The
   log2 transformed intensity data were quantile normalized and filtered
   to exclude those features where less than 20% of expression data have
   at least 1.75-fold change in either direction from the gene’s median
   value (BRB). Additionally, data were filtered for minimum intensity of
   256 (log[2]=8).

   Differentially reactive antigens were determined using class comparison
   analyses (BRB-Array Tools) [[152]68] at the significance thresholds for
   univariate tests of p≤0.001 and minimum fold changes of 1.5 between
   groups. Each batch was analyzed separately since our previous
   experiments [[153]64] showed that high variances could exist between
   batches, which introduce non-biological differences; furthermore,
   batch-wise normalizations were also omitted since those could distort
   expression data. Summary table of differentially reactive antigens,
   Uniprot accession numbers, fold changes, p-values and False Discovery
   Rates (FDR) are shown in [154]Supplementary Table 1.

   Quantitative trait analysis was executed in BRB Array Tools to test
   whether patients age was correlated with the expression of
   differentially reactive antigens. Summary table can be found as
   [155]Supplementary Table 5.

   Differentially reactive protein names were submitted and analyzed with
   Ingenuity ([156]https://www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) using Global
   Canonical Pathways (GCP) tool, which utilize right-tailed Fisher’s
   exact test for p-value calculations. Pathway-commons analyses were
   implemented in Webgestalt (Web-based Gene-set Analysis Toolkit;
   [157]http://webgestalt.org) [[158]69, [159]70, [160]71], which
   incorporate various tools different from Ingenuity. Webgestalt uses
   hypergeometric test for enrichment analyses and for each analysis the
   top 10 most significant categories were selected (as at least 2
   proteins per category). Comparing identified differentially reactive
   antigens (as gene set) with other publicly available microarray results
   we used Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) within GSEA, where
   oncogenic and immunologic signatures were tested
   ([161]http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) [[162]72,
   [163]73]. Cytogenetic mapping (enrichment) analysis was also performed
   in GSEA, then UCSC table browser and Genome graph tools were used to
   illustrate genomic locations.

   For KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), Reactome, Interpro
   protein domain-based functional classification and protein-protein
   interactions analysis and visualization we have utilized String (Search
   Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins;
   [164]https://string-db.org/) protein interaction database or through
   Reactome website ([165]https://reactome.org) [[166]74, [167]75,
   [168]76, [169]77].

   In each analysis, as background proteins (i.e. random entries), we have
   used all annotated proteins presented on the 16k protein microarray;
   except for cytogenetic map analyses (GSEA) where the whole human genome
   (as gene-positions) was applied (Genome Reference Consortium Human
   Build 38).

CONCLUSIONS

   Detecting tumor-associated antibodies represents a highly attractive
   way for early diagnostics of cancer entities. Earlier discovery studies
   explain the underlying biological phenomenon as the immune response
   against mutated or aberrantly expressed proteins, which results in
   elevated reactivity. We think that, on one hand, the majority of
   identified antigens derive from the clearance of necrotic cells, which
   upon dying release large number of “targets” for the immune system,
   regardless if mutated or not. These events are complemented with the
   degradation of extracellular matrix, which not only emit ECM
   (Extracellular Matrix) constituents into the tumor
   microenvironment/circulation, but triggers sequestered growth factors.
   On the other hand, the observed reduced reactivity can be explained by
   the immune suppressive environment, orchestrated by the tumor cells.
   Despite the above potential explanations, due to high complexities of
   molecular interactions, it is difficult to figure out why reactivity of
   certain proteins was increased or decreased in cancer samples.
   Nevertheless, findings from our study reflect that the underlying
   signaling pathways are highly comparable to and complementing the
   information derived from gene expression profiling experiments of tumor
   tissue samples. In conclusion, inferring molecular pathways from
   antibody profiling provides a new molecular pathological layer of
   information associated with the health status of patients. Besides, the
   identified differentially antigens can be further analyzed as potential
   biomarkers in diagnostic tests or as immune therapy targets.
