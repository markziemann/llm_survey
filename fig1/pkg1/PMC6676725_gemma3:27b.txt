Here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis methods used in the provided text, formatted for a table.

**1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**

DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery)

**2. Was a tool version number provided?**

No.

**3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**

*   GO (Gene Ontology)
*   KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)

**4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**

Not described.

**5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**

Fisher exact test.

**6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**

Benjamini-Hochberg FDR (False Discovery Rate) correction was used.
