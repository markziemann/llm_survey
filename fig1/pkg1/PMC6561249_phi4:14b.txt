To extract information regarding the pathway enrichment analysis from the provided article, let's focus on answering each question based on the available details:

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - The tool used for pathway enrichment analysis is STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins).

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**
   - Yes, the version number provided for the STRING tool is 11.0.

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**
   - The specific gene set library queried is not directly mentioned in the pathway enrichment analysis section, but since STRING is used, it typically includes databases like Gene Ontology (GO) among others.

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - The article does not describe whether a specific background gene list was defined for the pathway enrichment analysis using STRING.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**
   - The statistical test used for enrichment analysis is not explicitly described in the provided text.

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - The article does not specify whether false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied during the pathway enrichment analysis using STRING.

In summary, the article provides some details about the tools and version used for pathway enrichment but lacks specific information on gene set libraries queried, background gene lists, statistical tests employed, and FDR corrections.
