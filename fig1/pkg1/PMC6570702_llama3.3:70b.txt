Here are the answers to the questions:

1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?
The tools used for pathway enrichment analysis were not described in detail, but it is mentioned that "GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed" and that the authors used "miRTarBase" to obtain targeted mRNAs. Additionally, it is mentioned that the authors used "DAVID" or similar tools are not mentioned, but "DAVID" is not explicitly mentioned, however,  the online tool or software used for the GO term analysis and KEGG pathway analysis is not specified.

2. Was a tool version number provided?
Not described.

3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?
The gene set libraries queried were GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes).

4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described.

5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?
Not described.

6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described.
