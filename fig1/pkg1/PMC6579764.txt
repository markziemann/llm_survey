Abstract

   Understanding essential signaling network requirements and making
   appropriate adjustments in culture conditions are crucial if porcine
   pluripotent stem cells (PSC) are to achieve their full potential. Here,
   we first used two protein factors (LIF and FGF2) and kinase inhibitor
   combinations in attempts to convert primed type lentiviral-reprogrammed
   porcine induced PSC (Lv-piPSC) into naïve-like state and developed a
   medium called FL6i. In addition to FGF2 and LIF, this medium contained
   inhibitors of MAPK14, MAPK8, TGFB1, MAP2K1, GSK3A and BMP. Crucially,
   the usual TGFB1 and BMP4 protein components of many stem cell media
   were replaced in FL6i with inhibitors of TGFB1 and BMP. With this
   medium, Lv-piPSC were readily transformed from their original primed
   state into cells that formed colonies with typical features of
   naïve-state stem cells. The FL6i medium also assisted generation of
   naïve-type piPSC lines from porcine embryonic fibroblasts with
   non-integrating episomal plasmids (Epi-piPSC). These lines, despite
   retaining variable amounts of vector DNA, expressed higher endogenous
   pPOU5F1 and pSOX2 than Lv-piPSC. They have been cultured without
   obvious morphological change for >45 passages and retained pluripotent
   phenotypes in terms of upregulation of genes associated with
   pluripotency, low expression of genes linked to emergence of somatic
   cell lineages, and ability to generate well differentiated teratomas in
   immune-compromised mice. FL6i conditions, therefore, appear to support
   elevated pluripotent phenotypes. However, FL6i was less able to support
   the generation of embryonic stem cells from porcine blastocysts.
   Although colonies with dome-shaped morphologies were evident and the
   cells had some gene expression features linked to pluripotency, the
   phenotypes were ultimately not stable. Pathway analysis derived from
   RNAseq data performed on the various cell lines generated in this study
   suggest the benefits of employing the FL6i medium on porcine cells
   reside in its ability to minimize TGFB1 and BMP signaling, which would
   otherwise de-stabilize the stem cell state.

Introduction

   Pigs probably constitute the premier non-primate model for biomedical
   testing because of their physiological similarities to humans^[43]1.
   Accordingly, porcine pluripotent stem cells (PSC) potentially provide
   powerful tools for evaluating the safety and efficacy of stem cell
   based therapies, as well as having utility in the production of
   transgenic pigs and xenografts^[44]1,[45]2. However, the derivation of
   authentic porcine embryonic stem cell (pESC)^[46]3–[47]8 and transgene
   free porcine iPSC (piPSC)^[48]9–[49]12 that can readily differentiate
   into all cell lineages still remains problematic^[50]13, although
   several promising advances have recently been
   reported^[51]10,[52]14–[53]16.

   Most, if not all, piPSC lines depend on ectopic genes expressions to
   maintain self-renewal because of a failure to fully activate the
   endogenous genes required to provide a pluripotent
   phenotype^[54]7,[55]17–[56]19. The persistent expression of these
   reprogramming genes may complicate cell differentiation protocols, and
   there is concern that they may produce tumors in the treated animal.
   Various non-viral reprogramming methods have been tested to obtain
   transgene-free piPSC, but outcomes fail to up-regulate endogenous genes
   and whether or not the persistence of ectopic gene expression is
   required for pluripotency have been ambiguous^[57]18,[58]20–[59]22.
   There have also been consistent failures in generating pESC from the
   inner cell mass (ICM) and epiblast of porcine embryos, suggesting that
   special culture conditions are necessary to maintain stable endogenous
   pluripotency networks in pig cells. It has long been known that
   supplementation with certain cytokines and small molecule inhibitors
   and other fine tuning of the culture conditions can allow derivation of
   PSC from certain “non-permissive” mouse strains and rats^[60]23–[61]25
   and{Buehr, 2008 #141} permit generation of human PSC in various states
   of pluripotency^[62]26–[63]32.

   Here we report the development of culture conditions, based on the
   naïve human stem cell medium (NHSM)^[64]27, that permits conversion of
   primed/epiblast-types of piPSC into cultures with naïve-type
   properties. Two other goals were to employ similar culture conditions
   to produce piPSC from somatic cells by using non-integrating episomal
   plasmids and to generate genuine pESC from outgrowths of porcine
   blastocysts.

Materials and methods

Routine maintenance and culture conditions of PSC

   For routine maintenance, piPSC and pESC like cells (pESCLC) were
   cultured on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEF) in
   10 cm-culture dish (Corning), six-well tissue culture plates (Thermo
   Scientific) or twelve-well culture plates (Thermo) under 5% CO[2], 5%
   O[2], and 20% N[2] atmosphere in O[2]/CO[2] incubator (Heracell150,
   Thermo) with daily medium exchange. We employed an antibiotic-free
   culture condition, which provides an on-going means of monitoring
   aseptic technique by laboratory workers. Mycoplasma infections are
   regularly surveyed (every quarter) by MycoAlert™ Mycoplasma Detection
   Kit (Lonza). The cells used in the study were all infection free. The
   medium included: [1. F] standard hESC medium supplemented with 4 ng/ml
   human (h) FGF2 (in house produced from yeast)^[65]33 and 20% v/v
   knockout serum replacement (KOSR, Invitrogen)^[66]7,[67]34. [2. NHSM]
   knockout-DMEM (Invitrogen) with 20% KOSR, 1 mM glutamine (Invitrogen),
   1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml primocin
   (InvivoGen), 12.5 μg/ml recombinant human insulin (Sigma) and 20 ng/ml
   IGF1 (ProSpec) as basal medium. Cytokine and small molecules include
   20 ng/ml hLIF (Millipore), 8 ng/ml hFGF2, 2 ng/ml TGFB1 (Prospec), 2 µM
   p38i (MAPK14 inhibitor, BIRB796, Selleckchem), 5 μM JNKi (MAPK8
   inhibitor, SP600125, Tocris), 0.4 μM BMP inhibitor (LDN193189, Axon),
   3 μM GSK3A inhibitor (CHIR99021, STEMCELL Technologies), and 1 μM
   ERK1/2i (MAP2K inhibitor, PD0325901, Selleckchem)^[68]27. [3. FLB2i]
   10 ng/ml hLIF, 8 ng/mL hFGF2, 10 ng/ml BMP4 (R& D Systems), 3 μM GSK3A
   inhibitor, and 2 μM TGFB1 inhibitor (A83-01, Xcessbio)^[69]19. [4.
   FL6i] modified from NHSM by replacing TGFB1 with 1 μM TGFB1 inhibitor.
   Additionally, FGFR inhibitor PD173074 (STEMCELL Technologies) and JAK
   Inhibitor I (CAS 457081-03-7, Calbiochem) were tested in Lv-piPSC
   culture (Fig. [70]2b).

Generation of iPSCs from porcine fetal fibroblasts with episomal vectors

   Porcine fetal fibroblasts were reprogrammed with non-integrating
   episomal vectors according to previously described protocols^[73]35.
   3 μg of combined three episomal plasmids (Addgene #27077, 27078 and
   27079) containing human POU5F1, SOX2, KLF4, LIN28, L-MYC and p53 shRNA
   were electroporated with a Nucleofector II device (Lonza) and Amaxa
   NHDF Nucleofector kit (Lonza) into 6 × 10^5 porcine fetal fibroblast
   cells derived from day 34 conceptuses^[74]36. The following day, the
   cells were placed into three 10 cm dishes previously plated with iMEF.
   Next day the culture medium was switched to NHSM basal medium with FGF2
   and LIF (FL condition in the first dish), FLB2i medium in the second
   dish and FL6i medium in the third dish. 17-day post transfection,
   emerged independent colonies were mechanically isolated from the dishes
   and expanded. A total of two iPSC lines in FL, four lines in FLB2i and
   eight lines in FL6i conditions were established, respectively.

Collection, production, and culture of porcine blastocysts

   The collection, production and culture of porcine blastocysts was
   conducted by using methods described previously^[75]37. Porcine
   blastocysts were seeded on iMEFs and in pESC medium^[76]7, a 50:50
   mixture of DMEM low glucose and Ham’s F10 medium (Thermo), supplemented
   with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 2 mM glutamax, 0.1 mM
   ß-mercaptoethanol, 1x MEM nonessential amino acids, 1x
   antibiotic/antimycotic (Thermo) containing cytokines, and 20 ng/ml
   hFGF2 (in house)^[77]33. Two methods were used to generate pESCLC:
   plating day 7–8 of intact blastocyst and inner cell mass (ICM) isolated
   by immunosurgery^[78]38. Following 5–7 days of culture, we observed
   pESCLC primary colonies derived from porcine blastocysts. These pESCLC
   colonies were mechanically dissociated into several clumps by using
   pulled glass pipettes 10–15 days after seeding. Dissociated clumps were
   then re-seeded on fresh iMEFs, and subsequent pESCLC lines were
   routinely passaged via the pulled glass pipette method every 5–7 days.

Alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining and immunocytochemistry (ICC)

   AP staining was performed by the nitro blue
   tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate method (Promega). For
   ICC, cells were fixed in 4% w/v paraformaldehyde/PBS for 12 min, washed
   with PBS twice, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fisher
   Scientific) for 20 min After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated
   with 5% v/v goat or donkey serum (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min Cells were
   then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing,
   the cells were incubated with secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained
   with 6 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen). For
   POU5F1 staining on teratoma tissues, maximum-intensity projection of 3D
   montage images were obtained by using a Leica SP8 spectral confocal
   microscope (research.missouri.edu/mcc/leica_tcp_sp8_mp.php) to cover
   the large (mm size) area. Other Fluorescence images were taken under an
   Olympus IX70 inverted microscope at the Molecular Cytology Core at
   University of Missouri. Primary antibodies include: POU5F1 (1:1000 in
   house^[79]39 or 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-9081),
   SOX2 (1:1000; R&D Systems, MAB2018), NANOG (1:200; Abcam, ab109250),
   SSEA1 (1:50; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank [DSHB], MC-480),
   SSEA4 (1:50; DSHB, MC-813-70), KRT7 (1:100; DAKO, M701801-2), DESMIN
   (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-14026), NESTIN (1:100; Abcam,
   ab6320), SOX17 (1:100; R&D Systems, AF1924),

Embryoid body (EB) formation and in vitro differentiation

   Epi-piPSC lines were manually isolated from the culture dish coated
   with iMEFs, dissociated with Accutase (STEMCELL Technologies). The
   dissociated cells were allowed to form EB by the hanging drop
   method^[80]40 in a droplet medium. The medium was that used for prior
   culture but lacked supplementary cytokines and inhibitors. After five
   days, the EBs were transferred to adherent, gelatin-coated
   tissue-culture dishes and allowed to differentiate further for 2 weeks.

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and
quantitative PCR (qPCR)

   To analyze the gene expression patterns of undifferentiated or
   differentiated cells, total RNA from individual samples was extracted
   in STAT-60 (Tel-Test Inc) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
   cDNA was synthesized by using the SuperScript VILO kit (Life
   Technologies). PCR was performed with Taq DNA polymerase (PCR Master
   Mix, Thermo) under the following conditions: 95 ^°C for 15 min followed
   by 30 amplification cycles (95 °C, 15 s; annealing temperature of
   specific primers, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s) with an extension cycle at 72 °C
   for 1 min Quantitative PCR was performed with SYBR Green PCR kit (Life
   Technologies) on an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystem).
   GAPDH was used as a reference gene for this experiment. All the primers
   used in this experiment were shown in Supplementary Table [81]4.

RNA sequencing analysis

   Total RNA was extracted from the Lv-piPSC, Epi-piPSCs and pESCLC lines
   cultured in respective conditions by using STAT-60. The quantitation
   and quality control of RNA from all samples was performed on a Fragment
   Analyzer (Advanced Analytical), and cDNA libraries were constructed by
   standard methods (Illumina TruSeq mRNA stranded kit) with index
   adapters (Illumina TruSeq indexes). The RNA-Seq data were generated on
   the Illumina (HiSeq 2500 instrument) platform by 50 bp paired-end
   sequencing. The sequencing reads were aligned onto Sscrofa11.1
   reference genome by TopHat v2.1.0 software^[82]41 . The mapped reads
   were transformed into the count matrix with default parameters by HTSeq
   v0.8.0 software^[83]42, followed by normalization with DESeq v2
   software^[84]43. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified
   by means of the same software, DESeq2, based on negative binomial
   generalized linear models. GO enrichment analysis of the DEGs was
   performed by using PANTHER (www.pantherdb.org/)^[85]44. For the
   visualization of enriched GO terms in ranked lists of DEGs and their
   clustering, all heatmaps were generated by the Heatmapper
   (www.pantherdb.org/)^[86]45 with log2 transformed values.

Teratoma formation

   20 million cells of the Epi-piPSC, Lv-piPSC and Epi-hESC lines obtained
   by Dispase dispersion of attached colonies (1 mg/mL, STEMCELL
   Technologies) were centrifuged (200×g for 5 min), resuspended in 0.2 mL
   of original culture medium, and chilled on ice before mixing with
   0.14 ml of Matrigel (Corning) supplemented with ROCKi, Y-27632 (final
   10 µM). The solution was loaded into a 1-mL syringe (Becton Dickinson)
   and injected subcutaneously into 8 to 12-week-old non-obese diabetic
   SCID-γ mice (for all except Lv-piPSC-F, Jackson Laboratories) or CD-1
   nude mice (for Lv-piPSC-F, Charles River) on their flanks through
   22-gauge needles (10 million cells of the former and 1 million for the
   latter per site). The tumors were dissected out after euthanizing the
   mice and fixed in 10% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin overnight.
   Paraffin-embedded tissue was sectioned and then stained with H&E. All
   animal experiments were approved by the University of Missouri
   Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under Protocols 7170 and
   8053.

Statistical analysis

   For qPCR results, the mRNA abundance levels of a target gene were
   normalized to the internal control gene, GAPDH, and the relative
   expression value were determined by comparative threshold cycle
   method^[87]46. Data were analyzed by using the relative expression tool
   REST 2009 version 2.0.13^[88]47. DESeq2 was used to detect
   significantly differentially expressed genes in the RNAseq
   analysis^[89]43. For cell doubling time, the comparison was performed
   by permutation tests for the differences between groups of growth
   curves from the R project for statistical computing^[90]48.

Results

Transition of primed type porcine iPSC to naïve-like pluripotency state

   We examined whether the NHSM^[91]27 could be used for culturing the
   primed type lentiviral reprogrammed piPSC (Lv-piPSC) ID6 line that has
   been maintained in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with FGF2 (termed as F;
   Supplementary Table [92]1b)^[93]34. The human ESC (hESC) line (WA01/H1)
   and Lv-piPSC were adapted to NHSM on a feeder layer of irradiated mouse
   embryonic fibroblasts (iMEF). After 10-day of culture, colonies of both
   H1 and Lv-piPSC in F began to exhibit dome-shaped morphologies that
   resembled those of mouse naïve type ESC (Fig. [94]1a). However, unlike
   the hESC, Lv-piPSC were negative for alkaline phosphatase (AP),
   indicating a loss of pluripotency (Fig. [95]1a). Primed type Lv-piPSC
   were then tested for growth on NHSM with the following modifications to
   identify which component in that medium had caused negative
   consequences of maintaining AP activity: 1. NHSM with FGF2 and LIF but
   without inhibitors of MAP2K, MAPK8, MAPK14, GSK3A, and TGFB1; 2. NHSM
   without the two inhibitors of MAP2K and GSK3A; 3. NHSM without TGFB1;
   4. NHSM without inhibitor of MAPK14; 5. NHSM without inhibitor of
   MAPK8; 6. NHSM without inhibitor of BMP. (Supplementary Table [96]1a).
   Surprisingly, after 10-day culture, only condition 3 (NHSM without
   TGFB1) provided dome-shaped colonies that were AP-positive (Fig.
   [97]1b), suggesting the presence of TGFB1 that caused the loss of AP
   activity in Lv-piPSC. By replacing TGFB1 with its inhibitor, the
   proportion of compact dome-shaped, AP-positive colonies relative to
   flattened colonies increased nine-fold (Ratio in no TGFB1, 1.08; ratio
   with TGFB1 inhibitor, 9.92) (Fig. [98]1c). As a result, we developed an
   optimized medium containing a combination of FGF2, LIF, inhibitors of
   TGFB1, MAP2K1, MAPK8, MAPK14, GSK3A and BMP (termed FL6i medium) to
   convert the primed type Lv-piPSC-F into naïve type cells. To ratify the
   whether all the components (FGF2, LIF, inhibitors of MAPK8, MAPK14, and
   BMP) were required for maintaining the AP-positive/naïve type colony
   morphology, each compound was sequentially omitted from the FL6i
   medium. Only cells on the complete medium were converted from the
   primed to naïve-like state (Fig. [99]1d).

Characterizations of Lv-piPSC in FL6i medium

   The naïve like Lv-piPSC cultured in FL6i (Lv-piPSC-FL6i) not only
   resembled mouse naïve-type ESC (Fig. [102]2a), but were dispersed into
   single cells for passaging and had shortened cell doubling time (from
   17 h in F to 13.5 h in FL6i, p = 0.017). However unlike mouse ESC, they
   appeared to rely on both FGF/ACTIVIN/NODAL and LIF/JAK/STAT signaling
   for cell self-renewal (Fig. [103]2b). They were positive for the
   pluripotency markers SSEA1, NANOG, POU5F1 and SOX2 (Fig. [104]2c), and
   the expressions of several pluripotency-related endogenous genes
   (pNANOG, pPOU5F1, pSOX2, pMYC, pDPPA3) were significantly increased
   (Fig. [105]2d). Despite this upregulation of endogenous genes, the
   expression of the ectopic genes (hPOU5F1 hSOX2, hKLF4) used initially
   to drive induced pluripotency remained relatively unchanged under the
   new culture conditions (Fig. [106]2d). The Lv-piPSC-FL6i formed
   embryoid bodies and underwent spontaneous differentiation. The
   differentiated cells were positive for ectoderm and mesoderm markers,
   but they failed to express endoderm markers (Fig. [107]2e).

Derivation of episomal plasmid-mediated piPSC (Epi-piPSC)

   We next examined whether FL6i condition could be used to generate
   transgene-free piPSC by using non-integrating episomal
   plasmids^[108]35,[109]49. Porcine fetal fibroblast cells were
   transiently transfected with the plasmids^[110]35 and plated onto iMEF
   feeder layers under three culture conditions: 1, NHSM basal medium with
   FGF2 and LIF (FL); 2, a previously reported medium claimed to generate
   an intermediate pluripotent state in piPSC^[111]19 (FLB2i); 3, the
   newly developed FL6i described above. Two to three weeks after the
   transfection, primary colonies with flat morphologies were observed in
   FL, mounded colonies in FLB2i, and small dome-shaped colonies in FL6i
   (Fig. [112]3a). Individual colonies were manually picked and propagated
   by passaging under the three respective conditions (Fig. [113]3b),
   whereas colonies from FLB2i and FL6i conditions demonstrated homogenous
   POU5F1 expression and were undifferentiated (Fig. [114]3c). Colonies in
   FL condition were comprised largely of epithelial-like cells (Fig.
   [115]3b) with much reduced POU5F1 expression (Fig. [116]3c). As culture
   on FL was extended, the cells stopped growing and no iPSC line was
   established. However, it was possible to generate multiple piPSC in
   FLB2i (Epi-piPSC-FLB2i) and FL6i conditions (Epi-piPSC-FL6i). All were
   positive for AP and expressed POU5F1 and SOX2, but all stained
   negatively for NANOG (Fig. [117]3d). While Epi-piPSC-FL6i expressed
   SSEA1, the Epi-piPSC-FLB2i cells were SSEA4 positive (Fig. [118]3d).

   conditions after 40 days of extended culture. d AP staining and ICC of
   NANOG, SSEA1, SSEA4 and SOX2 of Epi-piPSC lines established in FLB2i
   and FL6i conditions

   To examine whether any of the reprogramming genes and the plasmids
   persisted in the established Epi-iPSC, six lines of Epi-iPSC (three
   from FLB2i, three from FL6i) were randomly selected from each culture
   condition after 80 days of continuous culture (15–20 passages).
   Specific PCR primers were designed to provide a comparison between
   transcript levels from endogenous pluripotency genes and those from the
   exogenous reprogramming genes. Although each reprogrammed cell line was
   weakly positive for expression of pPOU5F1 and pSOX2, values were quite
   variable. The levels of pNANOG transcripts were higher in FL6i than in
   FLB2i. As observed with the Lv-line in F, all six cell lines robustly
   expressed hPOU5F1 and hSOX2, (Fig. [121]4b). Detection of hPOU5F1,
   hSOX2, and hLIN28 with the vector backbone DNA (performed with gene
   specific primer and the vector-specific primer) (Fig. [122]4c; plasmid
   POU5F1, - SOX2, - LIN28), suggests that the episomal-plasmids had
   persisted in the cells, possibly through integration into host DNA.

   normalized against the expression level of GAPDH from the same sample
   (set as 1). Expression of the endogenous porcine genes (pPOU5F1, pSOX2,
   pNANOG in (a) and exogenous human genes (hPOU5F1, hSOX2 in (b) were
   determined by species specific primers for respective coding sequences.
   Expression values from the episomal plasmids (plasmid POU5F1, plasmid
   SOX2, plasmid LIN28 in (c) were quantified by paired primers of gene
   specific and the plasmid backbone. The primer information is shown in
   Supplementary Table [125]4

Teratoma formation from Epi-piPSC generated under different culture
conditions

   To evaluate the pluripotency of the newly developed Epi-piPSC and
   compare their ability in generating differentiated cell types, teratoma
   studies were conducted in immunodeficient mice. Teratomas from two
   Epi-piPSC-FLB2i and three Epi-piPSC-FL6i sublines were compared with
   those from three well characterized iPSC lines (a transgene free human
   iPSC, Epi-hiPSC and two Lv reporgrammed piPSC (Lv-piPSC-F) and
   Lv-piPSC-FL6i) (Supplementary Table [126]3). All were able to produce
   encapsulated solid tumors that were removed between days 38~ 90 after
   the injection. As expected, the Epi-hiPSC teratoma (Fig. [127]5a)
   included tissue representative of ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm, and
   POU5F1 expression was almost absent (Fig. [128]5a). The tumors produced
   by Epi-piPSC-FLB2i, Epi-piPSC-FL6i and Epi-hiPSC were softer than the
   Lv-piPSC teratomas and contained hemorrhagic areas when they were
   examined in cross-section (Figs. [129]5a–c). The tumor derived from
   Epi-piPSC-FLB2i lacked apparent endoderm derivatives but contained
   ectoderm and mesoderm (Fig. [130]5b). The tissue contained islands of
   POU5F1 expression between more differentiated areas (Fig. [131]5b).
   However, the tumors from Epi-piPSC-FL6i had overall lower POU5F1
   expression than those from the Epi-piPSC-FLB2i and also contained
   diverse tissue types representative of ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm
   (Fig. [132]5c). By contrast, the Lv-piPSC-F and Lv-piPSC-FL6i lines
   formed homogeneous tumors when viewed in cross section (Figs. [133]5d,
   e). The tumors were also largely undifferentiated, with a majority of
   POU5F1-positive cells. Nevertheless, islands of ectoderm, mesoderm and
   endoderm were scattered throughout the tissue from the Lv-piPSC-F lines
   (Fig. [134]5d). Tumors from Lv-piPSC-FL6i lines had a largely
   undifferentiated morphology and were POU5F1-positive throughout, except
   in diffused eosinophilic cells of connective tissue (Fig. [135]5e).

Attempts to generate pESC with the modified media

   First, we attempted to generate primed-type pESC in standard
   FGF2-supplemented medium, i.e., pESM conditions^[138]7 (termed F) from
   either day 7–8 intact blastocysts or immunosurgery isolated
   ICM^[139]38. Both approaches yielded similar types of outgrowth at
   similar efficiencies. Higher outgrowth efficiency was achieved with
   embryos that were beginning to hatch (Supplementary Table [140]2). The
   all outgrowths were similar in morphology and were positive for AP.

   Attempts were also made to generate pESC under FL6i (from both
   blastocysts and ICM, Supplementary Table [141]2) and FLB2i (from
   blastocysts only) culture conditions. Fewer outgrowths were observed
   than under F, and all the attached colonies were unstable, i.e. quickly
   differentiated and stopped proliferating within two weeks
   (Supplementary Fig. [142]1b, c). As an alternative to using these two
   defined media, outgrowths were generated under F (termed pESC like
   cells, pESCLC-primary; Figs. [143]6a, b, Supplementary Fig. [144]1a).
   These outgrowths were manually passaged and maintained in F (named
   pESCLC-F)^[145]7, Some of the primary outgrowths were also switched to
   FLB2i and FL6i conditions (Fig. [146]6a). Further growth on FLB2i
   failed, but, in FL6i conditions, small foci (50–80 µm in diameter)
   became visible within the colonies (Supplementary Fig. [147]1d) and
   adopted dome-shaped morphologies (Fig. [148]6e, Supplementary Fig.
   [149]1f). From these small foci, we generated a continuously
   proliferating cell line (named pESCLC-FL6i), whose morphologies
   resembled the earlier described Epi-piPSC-FL6i. After 10-day culture
   under FL6i, some of the colonies were sub-cultured into FLB2i
   conditions, and they continued to proliferate, forming mounded colonies
   resembling the Epi-iPSC-FLB2i colonies described earlier (Fig. [150]6d,
   Supplementary Fig. [151]1e). Thenceforth, all three lines, pESCLC-F,
   pESCLC-FLB2i and pESCLC-FL6i were manually passaged every 4–7 days on
   iMEF feeders. Each cell line proliferated for at least 15 passages over
   a ~2-month period.

   conditions

   All three pESCLC lines were examined for expression of POU5F1, NANOG,
   SOX2 and AP at 16, ~34, and ~46 days (passage numbers 2, 6, and 9,
   respectively), and compared with initial blastocyst outgrowths
   (pESCLC-primary) that had been collected at day 8~10 (Figs. [154]6b–e).
   The pESCLC-primary outgrowths expressed all three pluripotent markers
   examined (Fig. [155]6b). However, the cell cultures continued in F
   (pESCLC-F) showed increasingly lower SOX2 and POU5F1 expressions
   although NANOG and AP activity remained relatively constant (Fig.
   [156]6c). When the pESCLC were maintained in FLB2i (Fig. [157]6d) or
   FL6i (Fig. [158]6e), the marker expressions persisted without obvious
   decline.

Comparative gene expression analysis of cell lines

   Transcriptome profiles of the three putative pESC (pESCLC-F,
   pESCLC-FLB2i, pESCLC-FL6i), the three piPSC lines (Lv-piPSC-F,
   Epi-piPSC-FLB2i, Epi-piPSC-FL6i), each in duplicate representing
   different passage number, and two primary blastocyst outgrowths were
   compared by using RNAseq. A heatmap analysis of 19 known porcine genes
   whose expression has been linked to pluripotency^[159]19 was then
   generated (Fig. [160]6f). The primary blastocyst outgrowths
   (pESCLC-primary) had the most consistent upregulation of expression of
   these genes, including POU5F1 and NANOG, relative to any of the cell
   lines. One other feature of these primary cultures was relatively low
   SOX2, ESRRB, and KLF4 expression. However subsequent culture of these
   pESCLC cells in either FLB2i or FL6i medium led to a down regulation of
   the majority of these pluripotency genes, including POU5F1 and NANOG
   but not SOX2. By contrast, continued culture under F, had a more minor
   effect, although some key genes, e.g., POU5F1, SOX2, and ESRRB became
   expressed at lower levels than in their primary progenitors. Of the
   remaining cell lines, the lentivirus-transformed cells (Lv-piPSC)
   cultured on F medium clustered most closely to the blastocyst
   outgrowths, followed by the episomally-transformed cells (Epi-piPSC),
   cultured on FL6i medium, although in both there was marked down
   regulation of TET2 and TET3 genes (Fig. [161]6f).

   A principle component analysis (PCA) based on RNAseq data showed
   distinct distributions according to how the cells were created (pESCLC
   vs. piPSC) and culture conditions (Fig. [162]7a). The pESCLC lines were
   clearly separated according to the culture conditions, i.e., F vs.
   FL6i/FLB2i, on the PC1 dimension while Epi-piPSC (FL6i vs. FLB2i) lines
   showed differences primarily by PC2 values. Although the Lv-piPSC was
   grown in F, it showed a close relationship with Epi-piPSC cultured
   under FL6i conditions.

Epi-piPSC-FLB2i and Epi-piPSC-FL6i) and three pESCLC (pESCLC-F, pESCLC-FLB2i,

   We also compared the cell lines by hierarchical clustering of
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs; fold change ≥ 3, adjusted
   p ≤ 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. [165]2 and Supplementary Table [166]5).
   Here the culture conditions appeared to provide the greatest
   discrimination between groupings. Only 242 DEGs out of 17,650 genes
   analyzed distinguished the pESCLC-primary and pESCLC-F. Far larger
   numbers of DEGs separated pESC-primary from both pESC-FLB2i (1,945 DEGs
   from 18,085) and pESCLC-primary vs pESCLC-FL6i (2,058 DEGs from
   18,110), which is consistent with the PCA analysis (Fig. [167]7a).

   Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was used to gain insights into
   the degree to which the different cell lines showed signs of
   differentiation. (Supplementary Fig. [168]3). The top 10 categories in
   the overall GO list for all cell lines included developmental process,
   ectoderm development, cell differentiation, mesoderm development, and
   cell signaling pathways. Based on this outcome, we analyzed the
   relative expressions of 27 genes linked to early embryonic
   differentiation^[169]50,[170]51 (Fig. [171]7b). The pESCLC-primary and
   pESCLC-F group were again widely separated from the others, largely due
   to the high expression of genes of all the principal early embryonic
   lineages with the exception of ectoderm. The cell line that showed the
   lowest expression of differentiation markers was the Epi-piPSC-FL6i. In
   fact, differentiation markers for mesoderm and endoderm were relatively
   low in all FLB2i and FL6i cultures and in the Lv-piPSC-F, although
   there appeared to be some up-regulation of ectoderm markers.

   We next focused on DEGs linked to seven major signaling pathways (Fig.
   [172]7c)^[173]51,[174]52. Genes associated with TGFB and BMP signaling
   were upregulated in pESCLC-primary and pESCLC-F group, whereas low
   Notch and BMP signaling distinguished the Lv-piPSC and the Epi-piPSC
   grown on FL6i medium from the rest (Fig. [175]7c).

Discussion

   Here we have demonstrated that primed type Lv-piPSC transition to
   naïve-like pluripotency under the FL6i conditions. One major change
   made in FL6i relative to the original NHSM^[176]27 is the replacement
   of TGFB1 with a TGFB inhibitor, SB431542. TGFB1 activates ERK/MAPK
   signaling by SHC1 (SHC-transforming protein 1) phosphorylation as well
   as via SMAD2/3 signaling, both of which are crucial for the maintenance
   of pluripotency in epiblast-type human PSC^[177]53,[178]54. In
   contrast, TGFB1 is dispensable for the maintenance of naïve state mouse
   ESC^[179]55, although inhibition of TGFB signaling improves iPSC
   reprogramming efficiency^[180]56 and helps prevent rat PSC from
   spontaneously differentiating^[181]57,[182]58. The role of TGFB
   signaling in maintaining porcine pluripotency is less clear.
   TGFB/ACTIVIN/NODAL signaling is required for self-renewal of
   primed-type piPSC^[183]59 and putative porcine epiblast stem
   cells^[184]6. On the other hand, the TGFB/ACTIVIN inhibitor, SB431542,
   used in our experiments has been employed in a number of other
   protocols for generating piPSC^[185]10,[186]60,[187]61. Interestingly,
   all the piPSC generated in presence of SB431542 had morphologies
   similar to naïve state mouse ESC, whereas piPSC and pESCLC dependent on
   TGFB were in the primed state. Thus, like human and mouse, primed state
   pluripotency in porcine cells is probably dependent on the activation
   of SMAD2^[188]62,[189]63, while naïve state pluripotency requires
   inhibition of TGFB signaling^[190]64.

   In contrast to TGFB1, BMP4 signaling favors SMAD1/5/8 signaling, which,
   in turn, causes the activation of inhibitors of DNA binding proteins
   (IDs). In mouse naïve-type ESC, for example, BMP4 suppresses
   differentiation and, in combination with LIF, sustains
   self-renewal^[191]65. BMP4 inhibition also assists the stabilization of
   human ESCs in what is sometimes considered to be a ground state, i.e.
   naïve-type^[192]26. The NHSM also contains BMP inhibitor as an optional
   component to boost human naïve pluripotency^[193]27. FL6i, described in
   this paper, contains both inhibitors of TGFB1 and BMP. Under such
   conditions the Lv-piPSC demonstrated more compact, dome-shaped colony
   morphology, a shortened cell doubling time, increased AP activity, and
   tolerance to single cell passage, which are hallmarks of mouse, naïve
   state, PSC. FL6i also enhanced the expression of endogenous pluripotent
   genes, including NANOG, POU5F1, SOX2, MYC, and ZFP42, although the
   expression of the ectopic reprogramming genes remained high (Fig.
   [194]2d). We inferred that FL6i promoted porcine pluripotency and
   might, therefore, support the derivation of piPSC without accompanying
   transgene integration.

   Accordingly, we then attempted to generate piPSC from porcine embryonic
   fibroblasts in FL6i medium as well as in two other culture conditions
   via non-integrating episomal vectors^[195]35. The control medium
   containing FGF2 and LIF but no small molecule additions, did yield
   primary colonies (Epi-piPSC-F), although it proved impossible to derive
   stable cell lines from these starter colonies over extended culture
   (Figs. [196]3a–c) With both FL6i and FLB2i conditions, colonies with a
   naïve-type phenotypes were readily generated and propagated
   successfully over several weeks without either apparent loss of
   self-renewal or signs of differentiation (Fig. [197]3). However, none
   of the cell lines established were transgene-free at this stage (Fig.
   [198]4), although endogenous pluripotency genes were upregulated (Fig.
   [199]4) and expression of early differentiation genes low (Fig.
   [200]7b). FL6i culture conditions, in particular, provided piPSC
   superior to those cultured under FLB2i conditions with upregulation of
   the 19-gene cohort of pluripotency markers (Fig. [201]6f) and their
   ability to generate well differentiated tumors largely lacking
   expression of POU5F1 (Figs. [202]5b, c). A recent study employed the
   same episomal plasmid approach as ours with 2i plus FGF2
   condition^[203]14. Like ours, the generated piPSC showed presence of
   vector DNA, but integration-free piPSC could be selected from the low
   passage cells by further subcloning. We conclude that the piPSC
   generated under FL6i conditions have considerable promise.

   Reprogramming via ectopic transcription factors, as illustrated here
   with episomal plasmids has been categorized into two phases^[204]66.
   First, a stochastic phase in which expression of transgenes triggers
   random epigenetic events that cause global changes of the somatic
   epigenome into an ESC-like status^[205]67. Possibly, reprogramming in
   the basal FL medium initiated these events but did not allow
   progression to the second, deterministic phase, in which the presence
   of inhibitors, is believed to enhance the expression of endogenous
   pluripotency genes needed to sustain a stable pluripotency
   state^[206]66–[207]68.

   In the third part of this study, we attempted to generate pESC under
   different culture conditions. Efforts to obtain pESC directly from
   blastocysts under FLB2i and FL6i conditions failed. By contrast, basal
   FGF2 medium allowed initial attachment and colony formation, while
   subsequent culture under FLB2i and FL6i conditions permitted cell lines
   indistinguishable in appearance to naïve type piPSC to be isolated.
   Although the initial blastocyst outgrowths demonstrated relatively
   robust expression of genes associated with the pluripotent state (Fig.
   [208]6f) they also had higher level expression of early differentiation
   markers representing mesoderm, endoderm, primitive endoderm and
   extraembryonic lineages (Fig. [209]7b). Although these differentiation
   markers were downregulated in pESCLC under FLB2i and FL6i conditions,
   there remained a higher level of ectoderm markers (Fig. [210]7b) and
   relatively weak expression of the cohort of pluripotency genes (Fig.
   [211]6f). We conclude that these cell lines are still less than ideal
   as bona fide ESC.

   Stable bovine ESC lines were recently derived from preimplantation
   blastocysts by employing supplementary FGF2 and a WNT signaling pathway
   inhibitor^[212]69. A possible explanation for why FGF and WNT signaling
   inhibition in combination capture bovine pluripotency is their ability
   to regulate the balance of lineage specification between mesoendoderm
   and ectoderm^[213]70–[214]72. It appears that this equilibrium is more
   difficult to achieve in pESC. While FLB2i and FL6i conditions appear
   capable of blocking differentiation towards mesoendoderm, the cells
   seemed more prone to differentiate into ectoderm (Fig. [215]7b).
   Additionally, it is apparent that TGFB and BMP signaling must also be
   blocked in order to advance towards a pluripotent state in pESC. For
   example, there was a significant downregulation of the gene markers
   representing these two pathways in our Epi-piPSC-FL6i and Lv-piPSC but
   an upregulation under other FGF2 conditions (Fig. [216]7c). These
   observations may lead to optimized culture conditions that allow
   derivation of stable pESC in the near future.

   In conclusion, we report culture conditions of FL6i that support
   enhanced naïve-state pluripotency in Epi-piPSC. In particular, blocking
   the TGFB and BMP signaling pathways was an essential issue in reaching
   this goal. Although the final goal of generating transgene-free piPSC
   and authentic pESC by using the FL6i medium has not been achieved, the
   cell lines created point the way to establishing protocols that will
   finally allow stable, fully pluripotent porcine ESC and iPSC to be
   generated for potential biomedical and agricultural purposes.
