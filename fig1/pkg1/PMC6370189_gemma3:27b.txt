Here's a breakdown of the pathway/gene set enrichment analysis details from the provided text, formatted for a table:

**1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**

GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) was used.

**2. Was a tool version number provided?**

No, a tool version number was not provided in the text.

**3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**

The article doesn't explicitly state *which* gene set library was queried within GSEA. It only references that gene sets related to TCM (Central Memory T cells) and TEM (Effector Memory T cells) were used for comparison. We can infer they likely used standard GSEA libraries (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome) to define these TCM/TEM gene sets, but the specific library isn't stated.

**4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**

It is not explicitly stated whether a background gene list was defined. It's implied that the differential expression analysis provided the list of genes used as input for GSEA, but the background list for the enrichment wasnâ€™t mentioned.

**5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**

The text doesn't specify the exact statistical test used within GSEA. GSEA employs a non-parametric method using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to evaluate the enrichment. However, this detail is not explicitly mentioned in the text.

**6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**

Yes, false discovery rate (FDR) correction was used. The authors state that the enrichment was considered significant at P-value < 0.05 and FDR q-value < 0.25.



**Table summarizing the information:**

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| 1. Tool used for pathway enrichment analysis | GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) |
| 2. Tool version number provided | No |
| 3. Gene set library queried | Not explicitly stated (likely standard GSEA libraries like GO, KEGG, Reactome to define TCM/TEM sets) |
| 4. Background gene list defined | Not explicitly stated |
| 5. Statistical test used | Not explicitly stated (likely Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic as used within GSEA) |
| 6. False discovery rate correction used | Yes (P-value < 0.05 and FDR q-value < 0.25) |
