| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| 1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | Not described, although the text mentions using 9 online databases to predict target genes.  The specific tool used for the actual enrichment analysis isn't stated. |
| 2. Was a tool version number provided? | Not described |
| 3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)? | GO (Gene Ontology) was used, as stated in the text: "...for GO and pathway enrichment analyses to explore the potential effects." |
| 4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis? |  Not described |
| 5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis? | Not described |
