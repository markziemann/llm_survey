Abstract

Background

   Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading cause of cancer
   associated deaths worldwide. Independent studies have proposed altered
   DNA methylation pattern and aberrant microRNA (miRNA) levels leading to
   abnormal expression of different genes as important regulators of
   disease onset and progression in HCC. Here, using systems biology
   approaches, we aimed to integrate methylation, miRNA profiling and gene
   expression data into a regulatory methylation-miRNA–mRNA
   (meth-miRNA–mRNA) network to better understand the onset and
   progression of the disease.

Methods

   Patients’ gene methylation, miRNA expression and gene expression data
   were retrieved from the NCBI GEO and TCGA databases. Differentially
   methylated genes, and differentially expressed miRNAs and genes were
   identified by comparing respective patients’ data using two tailed
   Student’s t-test. Functional annotation and pathway enrichment,
   miRNA–mRNA inverse pairing and gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) were
   performed using DAVID, miRDIP v4.1 and GSEA tools respectively.
   meth-miRNA–mRNA network was constructed using Cytoscape v3.5.1.
   Kaplan–Meier survival analyses were performed using R script and
   significance was calculated by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.

Results

   We identified differentially expressed mRNAs, miRNAs, and
   differentially methylated genes in HCC as compared to normal adjacent
   tissues by analyzing gene expression, miRNA expression, and methylation
   profiling data of HCC patients and integrated top miRNAs along with
   their mRNA targets and their methylation profile into a regulatory
   meth-miRNA–mRNA network using systems biology approach. Pathway
   enrichment analyses of identified genes revealed suppressed metabolic
   pathways and hyperactive cell cycle signaling as key features of HCC
   onset and progression which we validated in 10 different HCC patients’
   datasets. Next, we confirmed the inverse correlation between gene
   methylation and its expression, and between miRNA and its targets’
   expression in various datasets. Furthermore, we validated the clinical
   significance of identified methylation, miRNA and mRNA signatures by
   checking their association with clinical features and survival of HCC
   patients.

Conclusions

   Overall, we suggest that simultaneous (1) reversal of hyper-methylation
   and/or oncogenic miRNA driven suppression of genes involved in
   metabolic pathways, and (2) induction of hyper-methylation and/or tumor
   suppressor miRNA driven suppression of genes involved in cell cycle
   signaling have potential of inhibiting disease aggressiveness, and
   predicting good survival in HCC.

Background

   Although last two decades have witnessed a great success in prevention,
   diagnosis, and therapy, cancer is still one of the leading cause of
   death worldwide with nearly 1.6 million new cases reported only in the
   United States in 2016 with almost one third estimated to die of the
   disease [[36]1]. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become the most
   common primary hepatic malignancy, with average survival rates between
   6 and 20 months [[37]2]. Incidence rate of HCC worldwide has increased,
   likely due to the rising incidence of chronic hepatitis B and C
   infections [[38]3]. It now ranks sixth in the world among all the
   malignancies, contributing to the third leading cause of mortality
   attributed to cancer [[39]4]. Although recent developments in the field
   of functional genomics have improved our knowledge greatly, the
   molecular pathogenesis of HCC is not fully understood [[40]5]. Numerous
   levels of transcriptional regulation are initiated during the process
   of tumor development and promote disease onset and progression. Hence,
   a better understanding of these transcriptional regulations and
   molecular mechanisms behind HCC onset and progression, and
   identification of potential biomarkers and targets are essential for
   effective diagnosis and therapeutic treatment.

   Gene expression is regulated in many ways including promoter/gene
   methylation, altered transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional
   modifications, mRNA transport from nucleus to cells, mRNA degradation
   by microRNAs (miRNAs) and post-translational modifications [[41]6]. DNA
   methylation of promoter regions of tumor-suppressor genes is known to
   inhibit transcriptional initiation, thereby, silencing the gene
   expression [[42]7]. Individual studies have shown that aberrant DNA
   methylation of different tumor-suppressor genes including APC [[43]8],
   CDKN2A [[44]9], RASSF1A [[45]10] and GSTP1 [[46]11] is correlated with
   clinical outcome of HCC. miRNAs are 20–22 nucleotide long, small
   non-coding RNAs which negatively regulate gene expression
   post-transcriptionally by preferentially binding to the seed sequence
   in the 3′-UTR of target mRNAs leading to either mRNA destabilization or
   degradation [[47]12]. miRNAs are known to regulate diverse biological
   processes and their aberrant expression has been reported to contribute
   to tumorigenesis and cancer progression [[48]13]. Aberrant expression
   of several miRNAs has been shown associated with disease onset,
   progression, therapy resistance, and metastasis in HCC [[49]14].
   Recently, whole genome profiling techniques have come up as powerful
   tools to identify novel molecular mechanisms and biomarkers of disease
   onset and progression in HCC [[50]15], therefore, we aimed (1) to
   identify the pathways dysregulated in HCC due to changes in DNA
   methylation pattern or due to miRNA mediated post-transcriptional
   inhibition of genes involved by using methylation profiling, and miRNA
   and gene expression profiling data and (2) to construct regulatory
   network of disease onset and progression.

   In this study, we identified differentially expressed mRNAs, miRNAs,
   and differentially methylated genes in HCC compared to normal adjacent
   tissues by analyzing gene expression, miRNA expression, and methylation
   profiling data of HCC patients from the National Center for
   Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI GEO) and
   integrated top miRNAs along with mRNA targets and their methylation
   profile into a regulatory methylation-miRNA–mRNA (meth-miRNA–mRNA)
   network. Flowchart of developing this network is shown in Additional
   file [51]1: Fig. S1. Pathway enrichment analyses of identified genes
   revealed suppressed metabolic signaling and hyperactive cell cycle
   signaling as key features of HCC onset and progression which we
   validated in 10 different HCC patients’ datasets. Next, we confirmed
   the inverse correlation between gene methylation and its expression,
   and between miRNA and its targets’ expression in various datasets.
   Furthermore, we validated the clinical significance of identified
   methylation, miRNA, and mRNA signatures by checking their association
   with clinical features and survival in HCC patients.

Methods

Patients’ data

   Patients’ gene methylation data were retrieved from the NCBI GEO
   database ([52]GSE29722 [[53]16], [54]GSE37988 [[55]17], [56]GSE44909
   [[57]18], [58]GSE54503 [[59]19], [60]GSE57956 [[61]20], and
   [62]GSE73003). Patients’ miRNA expression data were retrieved from the
   NCBI GEO database ([63]GSE10694 [[64]21], [65]GSE22058 [[66]22],
   [67]GSE31384 [[68]23], [69]GSE36915 [[70]24], and [71]GSE67140).
   Patients’ gene expression data were retrieved from the NCBI GEO
   database ([72]GSE15654 [[73]25], [74]GSE17856 [[75]26], [76]GSE20017
   [[77]27], [78]GSE25097 [[79]28], [80]GSE36376 [[81]29], [82]GSE39791

   and [99]GSE87630 [[100]36]). In addition, gene methylation, miRNA
   expression and gene expression data of HCC patients at The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were retrieved from Broad GDAC Firehose
   website: [101]https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/.

Identification of potential tumor suppressors and oncogenes in HCC using gene
expression profiling data

   Patients’ gene expression data retrieved from NCBI GEO database
   ([102]GSE76297, [103]GSE76427, [104]GSE84402, and [105]GSE84598), were
   normalized by calculating Z-scores for each gene within individual
   datasets. Later, these normalized data were pooled and gene expressions
   were compared between HCC and adjacent normal tissues using two tailed
   Student’s t-test. Bonferroni adjustment was applied to exclude false
   positives. Significance cut-off was taken as Bonferroni adjusted
   p < 0.05. Top 1000 significantly up-regulated and 1000 down-regulated
   genes in HCC as compared to adjacent normal tissues were selected and
   their potential to predict overall survival in HCC patients from TCGA
   database was checked to identify potential tumor suppressors and
   oncogenes. Schematic workflow is shown in Additional file [106]1: Fig.
   S1. Overall, the genes which were significantly down-regulated in HCC
   tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and whose higher
   expression was associated with good survival in HCC patients were
   selected as potential tumor suppressors (n = 335), and the genes which
   were significantly up-regulated in HCC tumor tissues compared to
   adjacent normal tissues and whose higher expression was associated with
   poor survival in HCC patients were selected as potential oncogenes
   (n = 415) (Additional file [107]2: Table S1).

Functional annotation and enrichment analysis

   Lists of potential tumor suppressors and oncogenes were separately
   uploaded to online freely available DAVID functional annotation tool
   ([108]https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) to identify GO biological
   process, GO molecular function, and KEGG pathways suppressed or
   hyperactive in HCC as compared to adjacent normal tissues. Tumor
   suppressors (n = 133) and oncogenes (n = 211) were identified by
   combining top 10 functional annotations from individual analysis
   (Figs. [109]1a and [110]2a).

Identification of differentially expressed catabolic and anabolic enzymes in
HCC

   Gene lists associated with top deregulated pathways like fatty acid
   degradation, amino acid metabolism, and purine and pyrimidine
   metabolism etc. were downloaded from online available KEGG database and
   were combined in one list. This list was then compared with the pool of
   previously identified top 1000 significantly up and down regulated
   genes in HCC as compared to normal tissues to identify the
   differentially expressed genes. Next, a total of 109 genes were
   shortlisted as having enzymatic function among differentially expressed
   genes. Later, web and literature based search was done to identify the
   type of function (anabolic/catabolic) for these enzymes. Overall, this
   analysis showed that out of 39 anabolic enzymes, 31 were upregulated
   and 8 were downregulated. On the other hand, out of 70 catabolic
   enzymes, 68 were downregulated and only 2 were upregulated. Cumulative
   catabolic and anabolic signature scores were calculated by adding the
   average Z-score of all the catabolic and anabolic enzymes respectively
   for both HCC and adjacent normal tissues from meta-analysis of data
   retrieved from NCBI GEO database ([115]GSE76297, [116]GSE76427,
   [117]GSE84402, and [118]GSE84598) (Additional file [119]3: Fig. S2).

Identification of potential tumor suppressor and oncogenic miRNAs in HCC
using miRNA expression profiling data

   Patients’ miRNA expression data were retrieved from NCBI GEO database
   ([120]GSE10694, [121]GSE22058, [122]GSE31384, and [123]GSE36915). miRNA
   expressions were compared between HCC and adjacent normal tissues using
   two tailed Student’s t-test to identify differentially expressed
   miRNAs. Bonferroni adjustment was applied to exclude false positives.
   Significance cut-off was taken as Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05. All the
   significantly up-regulated and down-regulated miRNAs in HCC as compared
   to adjacent normal tissues were selected and their potential to predict
   overall survival in HCC patients from GEO dataset [124]GSE31384 was
   checked to identify potential tumor suppressors and oncogenic miRNAs.
   Schematic workflow is shown in Additional file [125]1: Fig. S1.
   Overall, the miRNAs which were significantly down-regulated in HCC
   tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and whose higher
   expression was associated with good survival in HCC patients were
   selected as potential tumor suppressor miRNAs (n = 46), and the genes
   which were significantly up-regulated in HCC tumor tissues compared to
   adjacent normal tissues and whose higher expression was associated with
   poor survival in HCC patients were selected as potential oncogenic
   miRNAs (n = 27) (Additional file [126]4: Table S2).

Identification of differentially methylated genes in HCC using methylation
profiling data

   Patients’ methylation expression data were retrieved from NCBI GEO
   database ([127]GSE29722, [128]GSE37988, [129]GSE44909, [130]GSE54503,
   [131]GSE57956, and [132]GSE73003). Methylation scores were compared
   between HCC and adjacent normal tissues using two tailed Student’s
   t-test with significance cut-off of p < 0.05 to identify differentially
   methylated genes in HCC; hyper methylated (n = 2399) and Hypomethylated
   (n = 1243).

miRNA–mRNA inverse pairing using miRDIP tool

   Lists of identified tumor suppressor miRNAs (n = 46) and oncogenes
   (n = 211) were uploaded to online freely available tool miRDIP v4.1
   ([133]http://ophid.utoronto.ca/mirDIP/) to identify the oncogenic
   targets of tumor suppressor miRNAs. Top 5 tumor suppressor miRNAs with
   maximum targets among oncogenes were selected to be included in the
   network (Additional file [134]5: Table S3 and Fig. [135]2b; Top panel).
   Similarly, lists of identified oncogenic miRNAs (n = 27) and tumor
   suppressors (n = 133) were uploaded to the same tool to identify the
   tumor suppressor targets of oncogenic miRNAs. Top 5 oncogenic miRNAs
   with maximum targets among tumor suppressors were selected to be
   included in the network (Additional file [136]5: Table S3 and
   Fig. [137]1b; Top panel).

Identification of hypermethylated tumor suppressors and hypomethylated
oncogenes

   List of tumor suppressors was compared with that of hypermethylated
   genes to identify tumor suppressors which can be down-regulated due to
   gene hyper-methylation in HCC tissues as compared to adjacent normal
   tissues (n = 73) (Additional file [138]6: Table S4). Similarly, list of
   oncogenes was compared with that of hypomethylated genes to identify
   oncogenes which can be up-regulated due to gene hypo-methylation in HCC
   tissues as compared to adjacent normal tissues (n = 93) (Additional
   file [139]6: Table S4).

Constructing meth-miRNA–mRNA network

   miRNA-target interaction and methylation profiles were uploaded to
   Cytoscape software v3.5.1 to create tumor suppressor and oncogenic
   meth-miRNA–mRNA networks (Figs. [140]1c and [141]2c). In case, an mRNA
   was a target of more than 2 miRNAs, only top two miRNA–mRNA
   interactions were shown based on confidence score from miRDIP4 tool to
   keep interactions visually distinguishable in the network. Genes whose
   expression is predicted to change due to changing methylation pattern
   are marked by border of different color.

Gene sets, gene signatures, and Z-score calculation

   Gene sets related to metabolic processes and cell cycle signaling were
   downloaded from the GSEA website:
   [142]http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp. To calculate
   the scores for these gene sets, Z-scores of all the mRNAs in the given
   GS were summed for each patient. Two gene signatures (GS), consisting
   of list of genes identified as hypermethylated tumor suppressors and
   hypomethylated oncogenes in the meth-miRNA–mRNA network were named as
   hypermethylated-GS and hypomethylated-GS respectively. To calculate the
   scores for individual GS, methylation score of all the gene in the
   given GS were summed for each patient whereas to calculate the scores
   for methylation-GS (meth-GS), hypomethylated-GS score was subtracted
   from hypermethylated-GS score for each patient [[143]37]. This implies
   that the patients having high meth-GS score will have higher
   methylation of tumor suppressor genes than oncogenes and vice versa.
   Two GS, consisting of list of miRNAs identified as tumor suppressors or
   oncogenic ones were named as TS-miRNA-GS and OG-miRNA-GS respectively.
   To calculate the scores for individual GS, Z-scores of all the miRNAs
   in the given GS were summed for each patient whereas to calculate the
   scores for miRNA-GS, OG-miRNA-GS score was subtracted from TS-miRNA-GS
   score for each patient [[144]37]. This implies that the patients having
   high miRNA-GS score will have higher expression of tumor suppressor
   miRNAs than oncogenic miRNAs and vice versa. Two GS, consisting of list
   of mRNAs identified as tumor suppressors or oncogenes were named as
   TS-mRNA-GS (Fig. [145]1b, Bottom panel) and OG-mRNA-GS (Fig. [146]2b,
   Bottom panel) respectively. To calculate the scores for individual GS,
   Z-scores of all the mRNAs in the given GS were summed for each patient
   whereas to calculate the scores for mRNA-GS, OG-mRNA-GS score was
   subtracted from TS-mRNA-GS score for each patient [[147]37]. This
   implies that the patients having high mRNA-GS score will have higher
   expression of tumor suppressors than oncogenes and vice versa.

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)

   GSEA was performed using gene sets related to tumor progression,
   proliferation, and survival in HCC downloaded from the GSEA website:
   [148]http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp. Significance
   cut-off was taken as nominal p < 0.05.

Survival analysis

   Survival analyses for all the genes in TCGA database and for all the
   miRNAs in GEO dataset [149]GSE31384 were performed using R script
   [[150]38]. Survival curves were generated using Kaplan–Meier method.
   Patients without any available survival time or event were excluded
   from the corresponding patient groups. All the separations were done
   from the median. Significance of the differences in survival between
   two groups was calculated by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Significance
   cut-off was taken as p < 0.05.

Statistical analyses

   Venn diagrams were made using online freely available tool at
   [151]http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/. For correlation
   analyses, Pearson correlation co-efficients were calculated.
   Comparisons between two groups were made by two tailed Student’s
   t-test. Significance cut-off for correlation analyses and Student’s
   t-test was taken as p < 0.05.

Results

Constructing meth-miRNA–mRNA networks suggested suppressed metabolic
signaling and hyperactive cell cycle signaling in HCC

   In order to identify protein coding players of tumor progression in
   HCC, we performed a meta-analysis using expression profiling data of
   HCC tumors and their adjacent normal tissues from 4 different online
   available GEO patients’ datasets (Additional file [152]1: Fig. S1; For
   details, see “[153]Methods” section) and identified significantly up-
   and down-regulated genes in HCC tumor tissues as compared to adjacent
   normal tissues. Next, we narrowed down this list of genes by applying a
   stringent survival analysis threshold where we tested whether
   differential expression of these genes is associated with survival of
   HCC patients from TCGA database. Overall, theses analyses identified
   335 potential tumor suppressor genes which were down-regulated in HCC
   tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and whose higher expression
   was associated with good survival in HCC patients, and 415 potential
   oncogenes which were up-regulated in HCC tumor tissues compared to
   normal tissues and whose higher expression was associated with poor
   survival in HCC patients (Additional file [154]2: Table S1). Functional
   annotation and pathway enrichment analyses of potential tumor
   suppressor genes suggested that metabolic pathways are suppressed in
   HCC as compared to adjacent normal liver tissues (Fig. [155]1a). On the
   other hand, functional annotation and pathway enrichment analyses of
   potential oncogenes suggested that cell cycle signaling is hyperactive
   in HCC as compared to adjacent normal liver tissues (Fig. [156]2a). As
   major upregulated and downregulated pathways like fatty acid
   degradation, amino acid metabolism, and purine and pyrimidine
   metabolism etc. (Figs. [157]1a and [158]2a) involved both anabolic and
   catabolic enzymes, we compared catabolic and anabolic signature scores
   between tumor and normal liver tissues. Notably, anabolic enzymes were
   mainly upregulated whereas catabolic enzymes were mainly downregulated
   in HCC as compared to adjacent normal tissues (Additional file [159]3:
   Fig. S2; For details, see “[160]Methods” section) further confirming
   that metabolic imbalance is a key feature in regulating HCC onset and
   progression.

   Next, to identify miRNA modulators of tumor progression in HCC, we
   performed miRNA expression profiling analysis using data of HCC tumors
   and their adjacent normal tissues from four different online available
   GEO patients’ datasets (Additional file [161]1: Fig. S1; for details,
   see “[162]Methods” section) and identified significantly up- and
   down-regulated miRNAs in HCC tumor tissues as compared to adjacent
   normal tissues. Next, we narrowed down this list of genes by applying a
   stringent survival analysis threshold where we tested whether
   differential expression of these miRNAs is associated with survival of
   HCC patients from GEO patient’s dataset [163]GSE31384 (Additional file
   [164]4: Table S2). Overall, theses analyses identified 46 potential
   tumor suppressor miRNAs which were down-regulated in HCC tumor tissues
   compared to normal tissues and whose higher expression was associated
   with good survival in HCC patients, and 29 potential oncogenic miRNAs
   which were up-regulated in HCC tumor tissues compared to normal tissues
   and whose higher expression was associated with poor survival in HCC
   patients. Later, we performed miRNA–mRNA inverse pairing analysis and
   identified oncogenic targets of tumor suppressor miRNAs and tumor
   suppressor targets of oncogenic miRNAs. Top 5 oncogenic and tumor
   suppressor miRNAs having maximum targets (Additional file [165]4: Table
   S2, Figs. [166]1b; top panel and Fig. [167]2b; top panel) were
   incorporated into tumor suppressor and oncogenic miRNA–mRNA networks,
   respectively, along with their targets (Figs. [168]1c and [169]2c).

   Next, we performed methylation profiling analysis using data of HCC
   tumors and their adjacent normal tissues from six different online
   available GEO patients’ datasets (Additional file [170]1: Fig. S1; for
   details, see “[171]Methods” section) and identified significantly
   hyper- and hypomethylated genes in HCC tumor tissues as compared to
   adjacent normal tissues. Comparing these lists of genes with those of
   potential tumor suppressor and oncogenes helped us in identifying
   hypermethylated tumor suppressors and hypomethylated oncogenes
   (Additional file [172]5: Table S3). Interestingly, most of tumor
   suppressors and oncogenes affected by hyper- and hypo-methylation were
   also targets of oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs respectively
   (Figs. [173]1b; bottom panel and [174]2b; bottom panel). Lastly,
   methylation profiles of tumor suppressors and oncogenes were
   incorporated into respective miRNA–mRNA networks to develop tumor
   suppressor and oncogenic meth-miRNA–mRNA networks respectively
   (Figs. [175]1c and [176]2c).

   Overall, we constructed a tumor suppressor and an oncogenic network.
   The former comprises of oncogenic miRNAs targeting tumor suppressor
   genes involved in metabolic signaling, whose expression can also be
   suppressed due to hyper-methylation in HCC as compared to adjacent
   normal tissues. Whereas, the latter comprises of tumor suppressor
   miRNAs targeting oncogenes involved in cell cycle signaling, which can
   also be overexpressed due to hypo-methylation in HCC as compared to
   adjacent normal tissues.

Metabolic imbalance and hyperactive cell cycle signaling are key features of
HCC onset and progression

   As functional annotation and pathway enrichment analyses revealed that
   metabolic pathways are suppressed whereas cell cycle signaling is
   hyperactive in HCC compared to adjacent normal tissues, we aimed to
   validate our findings. In this line, we calculated the Z-score of
   different gene sets associated with metabolic pathways and cell cycle
   signaling for the patients from 10 different GEO datasets and compared
   them between HCC and adjacent normal tissues. Gene sets associated with
   metabolic pathways were significantly suppressed in HCC compared to
   adjacent normal tissues whereas gene sets associated with cell cycle
   signaling were significantly enriched in HCC compared to adjacent
   normal tissues confirming that metabolic imbalance and hyperactive cell
   cycle signaling are key features of HCC onset and progression
   (Fig. [177]3a). Interestingly, all the gene sets associated with
   metabolic pathways were positively correlated with our TS-mRNA-GS and
   those associated with cell cycle signaling were positively correlated
   with our OG-mRNA-GS (Fig. [178]3b). Notably, we observed highest
   difference between HCC and adjacent normal tissue in terms of
   TS-mRNA-GS and OG-mRNA-GS scores (Fig. [179]3c) as compared to any
   other gene set associated with metabolic pathways or cell cycle
   signaling (Fig. [180]3a) suggesting that the gene signatures
   (TS-mRNA-GS and OG-mRNA-GS) we developed have greater sensitivity and
   specificity to identify HCC onset and progression.

Hyper-methylation driven inhibition of metabolic pathways and
hypo-methylation driven activation of cell cycle signaling are associated
with aggressive state and poor survival in HCC

   After establishing that suppressed metabolic processes and hyperactive
   cell cycle signaling are major features of HCC onset and progression,
   we aimed to validate the methylation mediated regulation of metabolism
   and cell cycle signaling in HCC as proposed in the meth-miRNA–mRNA
   network and to identify its clinical significance in HCC. To this end,
   first of all, we checked the correlation of methylation status of genes
   we identified as hypermethylated or hypomethylated in HCC with their
   mRNA expression in patients from TCGA database and found an inverse
   correlation between methylation and expression of these genes
   (Fig. [183]4a–c) suggesting that methylation profile proposed in
   meth-miRNA–mRNA network has potential to regulate the metabolic
   pathways and cell cycle signaling in HCC. Next, we calculated meth-GS
   scores by subtracting the hypomethylated-GS score from
   hypermethylated-GS score for each patient (For details, see
   “[184]Methods” section) and checked whether it is associated with
   clinical features and survival of HCC patients from TCGA database.
   Vascular invasion is a critical parameter of tumor progression and
   disease aggressiveness in HCC [[185]39]. We observed that metabolic
   pathways associated genes are more methylated than cell cycle signaling
   associated genes in patients who experienced vascular invasion as they
   had high meth-GS score as compared to those who have no signs of
   vascular invasion (Additional file [186]7: Fig. S3a). We also observed
   high meth-GS score in stage III patients, Grade 3 tumors and in
   pathological tumor size T3 as compared to in stage I patient, Grade 1
   tumors and in pathological tumor size T1 respectively (Additional file
   [187]7: Fig. S3b–d). Notably, we found that high meth-GS score is
   associated with poor overall survival and relapse free survival in HCC
   patients from TCGA database (Fig. [188]4d, e) confirming that
   hyper-methylation driven inhibition of metabolic pathways and
   hypo-methylation driven activation of cell cycle signaling are
   associated with aggressive disease state and poor survival in HCC.

miRNA-GS is associated with less aggressive state and good survival in HCC
patients

   In order to validate the miRNA mediated regulation of metabolism and
   cell cycle signaling in HCC as proposed in the meth-miRNA–mRNA network
   and to identify its clinical significance in HCC, we first checked the
   correlation of expression of oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs with
   their tumor suppressor and oncogenic targets respectively
   (Fig. [191]5a, b) and found inverse correlations suggesting that
   miRNA–mRNA interactions proposed in meth-miRNA–mRNA network also have
   potential to regulate the metabolic pathways and cell cycle signaling
   in HCC. Next, we calculated miRNA-GS scores by subtracting the
   OG-miRNA-GS score from TS-miRNA-GS score for each patient (For details,
   see “[192]Methods” section) and checked whether it is associated with
   clinical features and survival of HCC patients. We observed that
   suppression of metabolic pathways associated genes by oncogenic miRNA
   is stronger than suppression of cell cycle signaling associated genes
   by tumor suppressor miRNAs in patients who experienced vascular
   invasion as they had low miRNA-GS score as compared to those who have
   no signs of vascular invasion (Fig. [193]5c). Notably, we found that
   high miRNA-GS score is also associated with good overall survival and
   relapse free survival in HCC patients from GEO dataset [194]GSE31384
   and TCGA database (Fig. [195]5d–f) confirming that reversal of
   oncogenic miRNA mediated suppression of metabolic pathways and
   induction of tumor suppressor miRNA mediated suppression of cell cycle
   signaling would lead to a less aggressive disease state and good
   survival in HCC.

mRNA-GS is associated with less aggressive state and good survival in HCC
patients

   In order to validate the clinical significance of protein coding genes
   in meth-miRNA–mRNA networks, we calculated mRNA-GS scores by
   subtracting the OG-mRNA-GS score from TS-mRNA-GS score for each patient
   (For details, see “[200]Methods” section), separated the patients’ data
   into low and high mRNA-GS expression groups, and performed Gene Set
   Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The results showed that genes
   down-regulated in HCC tumor tissues as compared to non-tumor tissues
   are enriched in patients having high mRNA-GS scores (Fig. [201]6a)
   confirming that the proposed TS-mRNA-GS is down-regulated whereas the
   OG-mRNA-GS is up-regulated in HCC tissues. In addition, the genes
   down-regulated in “proliferation” subclass of liver cancer were
   enriched in patients having high mRNA-GS score whereas genes
   up-regulated in “proliferation” subclass of liver cancer were enriched
   in patients having low mRNA-GS score (Fig. [202]6b, c) suggesting that
   the proposed imbalance of metabolic and cell cycle signaling can lead
   to increase in proliferative potential of HCC tumor cells. mRNA-GS is
   found positively correlated with prognosis in HCC as mRNA-GS score is
   higher in patients having good prognosis as compared to those having
   intermediate or poor prognosis (Fig. [203]6d). In two separate patient
   datasets, we observed that mRNA-GS was significantly down-regulated in
   patients who experienced vascular invasion as compared to those having
   no signs of vascular invasion (Additional file [204]8: Fig. S4a, b). We
   also observed high mRNA-GS score in stage III patients, Grade 3 tumors
   and in pathological tumor size T3 as compared to in stage I patient,
   Grade 1 tumors and in pathological tumor size T1 respectively
   (Additional file [205]8: Fig. S4c–e) confirming that the suppression of
   metabolic pathways and hyperactivation of cell cycle signaling are
   associated with aggressive and advanced disease state in HCC. GSEA
   revealed that genes whose downregulation is associated with poor
   survival in HCC and genes whose expression is correlated with lower
   risk of late recurrence in HCC are enriched in HCC patients having high
   mRNA-GS scores (Fig. [206]6e, f). Notably, we found that high mRNA-GS
   score is also associated with good overall survival and relapse free
   survival in HCC patients from GEO dataset [207]GSE15654 and TCGA
   database (Fig. [208]6g–i) confirming that restoring metabolic pathways
   and suppressing cell cycle signaling would lead to a less aggressive
   disease state and good survival in HCC.

Discussion

   In this study, we systematically identified differentially expressed
   mRNAs, miRNAs, and differentially methylated genes in HCC compared to
   normal adjacent tissues by analyzing gene expression, miRNA expression,
   and methylation profiling data of HCC patients from NCBI GEO database
   and integrated top miRNAs along with mRNA targets and their methylation
   profile into a regulatory meth-miRNA–mRNA network (Figs. [215]1 and
   [216]2). Changes in DNA and/or promoter methylation patterns of
   individual or set of genes have been implicated in HCC onset and
   progression by modulating gene expression patterns of individual cells
   and/or tissue as a whole [[217]8–[218]11, [219]18], but a systematic
   methylation signature based study was lacking in the field. To the best
   of our knowledge, this is the first instance where altered methylation
   profile between tumor and adjacent normal tissues has been integrated
   into a network along with expression profiling data in HCC. We found
   inverse correlation between gene methylation and its expression for
   most of the identified hypo- and hyper-methylated genes
   (Fig. [220]4a–c) which needs to be validated in vitro and in vivo to
   certify the identified meth-GS as prognostic factor for clinical
   outcome and survival in HCC patients (Fig. [221]4d, e, Additional file
   [222]7: Fig. S3).

   Similar to changes in DNA methylation pattern, altered miRNA expression
   has also been shown to regulate gene expression, but at
   post-transcriptional level [[223]13, [224]40]. Considerable amount of
   research has identified differentially expressed miRNAs between HCC and
   adjacent normal tissues; thus, regulating cellular processes like
   metabolism, cell cycle, proliferation and apoptosis by suppressing the
   expression of their target mRNAs [[225]41]. Most of these studies were
   based on single miRNA/single target approach and very few studies have
   endeavored to identify the combinatorial effect of differentially
   expressed miRNAs in HCC by miRNA-gene interaction networks [[226]42,
   [227]43]. In this study, we have reported five oncogenic miRNAs
   (miR-330-3p, miR-671-3p, miR-671-5p, miR-877-5p and miR-939-5p) which
   are upregulated in HCC, and five tumor suppressor miRNAs (miR-105-5p,
   miR-149-3p, miR-194-3p, miR-200b-3p and miR-340-5p) which tend to be
   downregulated in HCC (Figs. [228]1 and [229]2). Notably, some of these
   miRNAs have already been proposed as oncogenic or tumor suppressor
   miRNAs in HCC or other cancer types confirming the significance of our
   findings. For instance, miR-330-3p has been reported as oncogenic miRNA
   in non-small-cell cancer promoting cell proliferation, cell invasion
   and metastasis [[230]44, [231]45] whereas miR-105-5p was found
   downregulated in HCC and correlated with good prognosis and survival in
   HCC [[232]46]. In addition, miR-149-3p has been shown inhibiting
   proliferation, migration and invasion in bladder cancer [[233]47] and
   miR-200b-3p was found to inhibit growth and metastasis in breast and
   prostate cancer cells by regulating different targets [[234]48,
   [235]49]. As aberrant miRNA expression go hand in hand with altered
   methylation pattern to modulate gene expression patterns and regulating
   specific oncogenic phenotype, we integrated both parameters along with
   gene expression patterns into our regulatory meth-miRNA–mRNA network to
   better understand the molecular basis of HCC onset and progression. We
   found inverse correlations between expression of miRNAs and their
   targets (Fig. [236]5a, b) which needs to be validated in vitro and in
   vivo to certify the identified miRNA-GS as diagnostic factor for
   clinical outcome and survival in HCC patients (Fig. [237]5c–f).

   Pathway enrichment analyses of identified tumor suppressors and
   oncogenes revealed suppression of metabolic pathways like fatty acid
   degradation and amino acid metabolism, and hyperactive cell cycle
   signaling assisted with aberrant DNA replication and, purine and
   pyrimidine metabolism as key features of HCC onset and progression
   (Figs. [238]1 and [239]2) which we validated in 10 different HCC
   patients’ datasets (Fig. [240]3) and found correlated with clinical
   characteristics and survival in HCC patients (Fig. [241]6d–i,
   Additional file [242]8: Fig. S4). Liver is metabolic hub of the body
   and plays crucial part in lipid and fatty acid metabolism. Increasing
   evidence has shown that aberrant activation of lipogenesis due to
   deregulated lipid metabolism play key role in regulating tumor growth
   and metastasis in HCC [[243]50–[244]52]. Progression through cell cycle
   is tightly controlled by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)
   and aberrant expression of these genes can trigger cell cycle
   programming to run at a faster pace [[245]53]. We observed upregulation
   of different cyclins (CCNA2, CCNB1, CCNB2), cyclin dependent kinases
   (CDK2), cell cycle associated transcription factors (E2F6, E2F7, E2F8)
   and phosphatases (CDC20, CDC25A, CDC25C) in HCC, which agrees with the
   existing literature reporting the overexpression of cell cycle related
   genes in different cancer types including HCC [[246]54–[247]56]. DNA
   replication during S-phase of cell cycle is one of the crucial step in
   the completion of cell cycle which also needs supplementation of
   purines and pyrimidines to build the macromolecules [[248]57].
   Similarly, availability of excessive amino acid pool due to decreased
   catabolic degradation go hand in hand to fulfil the production of
   protein products in cells undergoing uncontrolled cell division
   [[249]58]. These existing literature are also in line with our findings
   that catabolic enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism and, purine
   and pyrimidine metabolism are downregulated whereas anabolic enzymes
   are upregulated (Additional file [250]3: Fig. S2) in HCC as compared to
   adjacent normal tissues.

   Although independent studies have implicated the inhibited metabolic
   processes and the aberrant cell cycle progression in HCC
   [[251]59–[252]61], we have shown that both events happen side by side
   and collectively contribute to the onset and progression of the
   disease. But we still need to identify the causal relationship between
   these events; whether suppressed metabolic signaling triggers cell
   proliferation to efficiently fulfil metabolic tasks resulting in onset
   and progression of HCC, or it is hyperactive cell cycle signaling which
   keeps cell’s focus on proliferation rather than performing metabolic
   processes resulting in onset and progression of HCC.

Conclusions

   Overall, we suggest that simultaneous (1) reversal of hyper-methylation
   and/or oncogenic miRNA driven suppression of genes involved in
   metabolic pathways, and (2) induction of hyper-methylation and/or tumor
   suppressor miRNA driven suppression of genes involved in cell cycle
   signaling have potential of inhibiting disease aggressiveness, and
   predicting good survival in HCC.
