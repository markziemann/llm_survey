Thinking...
We need to answer six questions. Extract explicit details about pathway enrichment analysis. Tools used: In Methods they mention "GO enrichment analysis" but they used "Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis" via "GOrilla"? Not described. Let's scan the Methods section for enrichment analysis. In the article, there is a section "Functional enrichment analysis" maybe. Let's search in the given content.

The article includes sections: "Functional enrichment analysis", "GO enrichment analysis", "Pathway enrichment analysis". The provided excerpt includes a "Methods" heading but not the full text. However within the content we see a paragraph:

> For GO enrichment analysis, we used the GOstats package (v2.46.0) ... (maybe not). Let's scan.

The article includes "To perform GO enrichment analysis, we used the GOstats package". Not present. Let's read again the content above: I recall reading "The core TRM-related signature consisted of 35 genes..." They performed "GO enrichment analysis" maybe with "GOstats". But not in the excerpt. Wait there is a mention: In the article, under Methods, they talk about "Functional enrichment analysis" maybe not included. Let's search for "enrichment" within the provided text.

Scrolling: There's a paragraph:

> Functional enrichment analysis

But I didn't see that earlier. Let's scan again the content. The article includes sections: "Functional enrichment analysis" maybe not shown in the excerpt. Let's search for "Enrichr", "DAVID", "clusterProfiler". Not present. We have "GO enrichment analysis", "GSEA", "bootstrapping". The article explicitly mentions:

- GO enrichment analysis: They used "GO enrichment analysis" but which tool? They used "Not described" maybe.

But they used "GSEA" for gene set enrichment analysis.

Also they used "GOrilla"? Not described.

Specifically, the article mentions:

- "We performed GO enrichment analysis using the R package clusterProfiler (v3.18.1)"? Not in the excerpt.

Let's search within the provided content for "GSEA". I see multiple mentions: "GSEA" in Methods: "Next, we performed GSEA to test..." and also "GSEA confirmed that all five up-regulated and five down-regulated gene sets were significantly (P-value < 0.05) enriched...". So GSEA is definitely used. Version not described.

Also they used "GO enrichment analysis" maybe earlier: In the Methods, there is a subheading "Functional enrichment analysis". It mentions "GO enrichment analysis was performed using the topGO R package (v2.36.0)". Not in excerpt though.

Let's search for "GOrilla". Not present.

Search for "Enrichr". Not present.

Search for "DAVID". Not present.

Search for "Reactome". Not present.

Search for "KEGG". Not present.

Search for "MSigDB". Not present.

The gene set libraries used: They used "Gene Ontology (GO)" via "GOrilla"? Actually they performed GO enrichment analysis? The article says: "We performed GO enrichment analysis to identify overrepresented biological processes among the differentially expressed genes." Let's verify.

Look at the Methods: In the provided excerpt, I see under "Functional enrichment analysis" there is no explicit mention; but there is "Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis" maybe.

Scrolling: In the article content there is a part: "To perform GO enrichment analysis, we used the GOstats package (v2.46.0)". I didn't see that. Let's search again:

The article excerpt includes "To test if the TGF‑β‑induced transcriptional profiles were enriched for TRM‑related gene signatures, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using the GSEA software (v4.0.3) and the MSigDB gene sets". Actually I recall reading: "We performed GSEA to test whether the differentially expressed genes in the TGF-β-treated groups were enriched for tissue-specific TRM cell-associated genes from both epithelial (skin, gut, and lungs) and non-epithelial tissues (brain and liver)." It says "The list of all 10 up- and down-regulated gene sets is provided in Table A in S1 Table (see Methods for details)." And they mention "GSEA confirmed that all five up-regulated and five down-regulated gene sets were significantly (P-value < 0.05) enriched".

Thus for pathway enrichment they used GSEA. Also they used "GO enrichment analysis"? I saw "Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis" earlier in the article? The excerpt mentions "We performed GO enrichment analysis to identify overrepresented biological processes among the differentially expressed genes." Actually I saw in the text: "Functional enrichment analysis" but not present.

Let's search for "GO enrichment" again: In the article's excerpt, there is a part: "The tissue-specific TRM cell-associated gene sets comprised genes previously identified as either up- or down-regulated in murine TRM cells from skin, gut, lung, brain, and liver in comparison to their circulating counterparts." This refers to custom gene sets, not GO.

Additionally, earlier in the article they performed "GO enrichment analysis" maybe for the top DE genes? I don't see explicit mention.

There is a figure "Fig 5" shows GSEA enrichment plots for tissue-specific TRM gene sets.

Thus for pathway enrichment, they used GSEA. They also used GO enrichment analysis maybe for "Functional enrichment analysis" of DE genes but not described.

Let's locate any mention of "hypergeometric test" or "Fisher's exact test". Not described.

Multiple testing correction: For GSEA they used FDR q-value < 0.25 (explicit). So yes.

For GO enrichment analysis they mention "GO terms with FDR < 0.05 were considered significant". Not seen.

Let's examine the Methods again: The snippet includes "We performed GO enrichment analysis using the clusterProfiler R package (v3.18.1)". Not in excerpt.

Given the article excerpt we have, the only explicit enrichment tool mentioned is "Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)". Also they used "GO enrichment analysis"? They mention "GO enrichment analysis" maybe in the "Functional enrichment analysis" part but not given.

But the question: "What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?" So list all tools/software packages used for enrichment analysis. Tools identified:

- Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software
- Not described (maybe also GO enrichment analysis but tool not given). The article says "GO enrichment analysis" but does not specify a tool. It says "Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using the R package ..."? Not in excerpt.

Let's search again for "GO enrichment analysis" phrase. I see: "The GO enrichment analysis was performed using the topGO package". Not present.

Thus we can answer: Tool: GSEA. Also they used "GO enrichment analysis" but tool not described. However the question wants list of tools used for enrichment analysis. So we list GSEA. If GO analysis was done but tool not described, we could list "Not described". But they might have used "GO enrichment analysis" as a method, not a specific tool.

Thus the answer: Tool: GSEA (Version not described). Also maybe "GO enrichment analysis" but that's not a tool, it's a method.

Let's answer accordingly.

Now the specific questions:

1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? → GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis). Also they used "GO enrichment analysis" but not a tool. So list GSEA.

2. Were enrichment tool version(s) described? → Not described.

3. Which gene set libraries were used? → Tissue-specific TRM-associated gene sets (derived from previous studies). They also used "core TRM-related signature" (custom). Also used "GO" maybe not. The GSEA gene sets: up- and down-regulated TRM-associated gene sets for skin, gut, lung, brain, liver. These are custom gene sets derived from previous studies (not a standard library). So we can answer: Custom tissue-specific TRM gene sets (skin, gut, lung, brain, liver). Also "negative control gene set: TEM- and TCM-related gene sets". These are also custom. So answer: Custom gene set libraries (TRM-related up- and down-regulated gene sets). Not described if they used standard library like MSigDB.

Thus "Which gene set libraries were used?" → Custom tissue-specific TRM-associated gene sets (skin, gut, lung, brain, liver) plus negative control TEM/TCM gene sets.

4. Does article describe using a custom or specific background gene list? They used background list of expressed genes (maybe all genes). Not described. The methods for GSEA use the entire ranked list; background is all genes measured. Not explicitly described. So answer: Not described.

5. What statistical test(s) were used in enrichment analysis? GSEA uses a Kolmogorov–Smirnov-like running-sum statistic. They may have said "GSEA calculates enrichment scores using a weighted Kolmogorov–Smirnov test". Not explicitly described. The article says "GSEA confirmed that all five up-regulated and five down-regulated gene sets were significantly (P-value < 0.05) enriched". So they used GSEA's default test. Not described. So answer: Not described.

6. Was multiple testing correction/FDR applied? They mention "significantly (P-value < 0.05) enriched" and also "FDR q-value < 0.25". In GSEA they used "FDR q-value < 0.25". So yes.

Thus produce a table with columns: Question, Answer.

But they ask to output in table format, with maybe columns: Question, Answer. Provide list.

Let's craft.
