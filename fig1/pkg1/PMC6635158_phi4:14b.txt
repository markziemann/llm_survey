To analyze how pathway enrichment analysis was conducted in this scientific article, here's a detailed breakdown based on the information provided:

1. **Tool Used for Pathway Enrichment Analysis**:  
   - The study mentions using KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis.
   
2. **Version Number Provided**:  
   - Not described. There is no mention of a specific version number for the tool used.

3. **Gene Set Library Queried**:  
   - The gene set library queried was KEGG, as indicated by the reference to "KEGG pathway" in the text.

4. **Background Gene List Defined**:  
   - Not described. The article does not specify if a background gene list was defined for the pathway enrichment analysis.

5. **Statistical Test Used for Enrichment Analysis**:  
   - While specific tests are not mentioned, KEGG typically uses statistical methods like Fisherâ€™s exact test or hypergeometric test for pathway enrichment.

6. **False Discovery Rate Correction**:  
   - Not described. There is no information provided on whether false discovery rate (FDR) correction was used to control the number of false positives in the analysis.

This summary captures the details regarding the pathway enrichment analysis as reported in the article, with emphasis on areas where specifics are not explicitly mentioned.
