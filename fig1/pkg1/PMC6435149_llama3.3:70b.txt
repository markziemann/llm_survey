After carefully examining the article, here are the answers to your questions:

1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?
The article does not specifically mention the tool used for pathway enrichment analysis, but it mentions that "pathway analysis" was conducted. However, based on the context and the types of pathways mentioned (e.g., p53, Sirtuin, AMPK), it appears that a bioinformatics tool or software was likely used, but the specific tool is not described.

2. Was a tool version number provided?
Not described.

3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?
The article mentions several pathways, including p53, Sirtuin, and AMPK, which are part of various gene set libraries, but it does not specifically mention which gene set library was queried. However, based on the context, it appears that the authors may have used a combination of gene set libraries, including possibly KEGG, given the mention of specific pathways like p53 and AMPK.

4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described.

5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?
Not described.

6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?
Not described.

Here is the output data in a table format:
