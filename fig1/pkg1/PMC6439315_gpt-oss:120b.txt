Thinking...
We need to read the article text for pathway enrichment analysis. In Methods: "Pathway enrichment analysis" details: In Methods section: "The top 10 significantly enriched KEGG pathways were listed..." Wait look at article:

From Methods: "KEGG enrichment analysis" maybe mentioned. Let's search.

In Data extraction part: "The top 10 significantly enriched KEGG pathways were listed..."

But we need to extract explicit statements.

Reading the Methods excerpt: 

"To further address the role of FOS in schizophrenia pathogenesis, we analyzed human postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples and brain tissues of a schizophrenia 22q11-deletion mouse model...".

But for enrichment: In Methods: 
"Protein functional network analysis was performed using... Not for enrichment."

Scrolling: In Methods part: "The top 10 significantly enriched KEGG pathways were listed..."

Actually the article states: "KEGG enrichment analysis results, which listed “AMPH addiction” as one of the top 10 significantly enriched KEGG pathways." Also earlier: "The results of KEGG enrichment analysis listed “AMPH addiction” as one of the top 10 significantly enriched KEGG pathways." Also "the ratio of non-coding to protein-coding genes is considered..."

But the tool used for enrichment: The article says: "The top 10 significantly enriched KEGG pathways were listed using the KEGG enrichment analysis." But which tool? It might mention "clusterProfiler", "DAVID", "Enrichr", "GSEA". Let's search.

In Methods: "The associated KEGG pathway analysis was performed using the online tool "Not described"? Let's read the Methods paragraph again.

Methods: "The top 10 significantly enriched KEGG pathways were listed" but no specific tool mentioned. Wait there is a mention: "the KEGG enrichment analysis results". Not a tool name.

Also: "To identify the associated pathways, we performed KEGG enrichment analysis." Not described which tool.

In Results: "Our KEGG enrichment analysis results, which listed “AMPH addiction” as one of the top 10 significantly enriched KEGG pathways."

Thus the tool is not explicitly named. Could be "KEGG enrichment analysis". So answer: tool: "Not described". version: Not described. Gene set library: KEGG (explicitly mentioned). Background list: Not described. Statistical test: Not described. Multiple testing correction: Not described.

But there may also be mention of "KEGG" via "pathway enrichment analysis". The article says: "The associated KEGG enrichment analysis" but not specify tool.

Thus answer accordingly.

Now produce table with rows for each question.

Let's compile.

1. Tool used: Not described (no tool name).

2. Version: Not described.

3. Gene set libraries: KEGG.

4. Custom background: Not described.

5. Statistical test: Not described.

6. Multiple testing correction: No (since not mentioned) -> "No".

We must answer "Yes" only if explicit. So answer "No" for multiple testing correction.

Now format table.

...done thinking.
