Okay, I need to figure out how to answer these six questions about the pathway enrichment analysis in this scientific article. Let me start by reading through the Methods section and other relevant parts carefully.

First question: What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? Looking at the Methods section under "Positive Selection Analysis," it mentions that GO category enrichment was performed using the STRING database online software. So, the tool is STRING.

Second question: Was a tool version number provided? In the Software Versions subsection at the end of the Methods, I see that STRING 11.0 was used. So yes, the version is specified as 11.0.

Third question: What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)? The text says "GO category enrichment," so they specifically looked into Gene Ontology categories. Therefore, it's GO.

Fourth question: Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis? Hmm, the article doesn't mention anything about using a specific background gene list in the context of the STRING analysis. It just states that they performed GO category enrichment among positively selected genes. So I think this detail isn't provided.

Fifth question: What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis? The Methods don't specify which statistical test was applied by STRING for the GO enrichment. They mention a χ² test in the context of PAML models, but that's part of the positive selection analysis, not the pathway enrichment itself. So this isn't described here.

Sixth question: Was false discovery rate correction used? Again, there's no mention of FDR or multiple testing corrections in relation to the pathway enrichment analysis using STRING. The article focuses more on the χ² test for model comparisons, which is part of a different analysis step.

So putting it all together, I can answer each point based on what's provided and note where information isn't available.
