Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the pathway enrichment analysis was conducted in this scientific article. The user has asked me six specific questions about the methods used. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, I need to understand what each question is asking and where to find the information in the provided text. Since the text includes both the main article and supplementary materials, I'll have to look through all sections carefully.

1. **What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - I remember that many biological studies use tools like DAVID, GSEA, or Metascape for pathway analysis. Looking at the Methods section, the authors mentioned using 9 online databases but didn't specify which ones. They talked about target gene prediction and functional annotation but didn't name a specific tool for pathway enrichment.

2. **Was a tool version number provided?**
   - Skimming through the article again, I don't see any mention of version numbers for the tools they used. It's common to omit version details in some publications, so this might just be missing.

3. **What gene set library was queried (e.g., GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)?**
   - The Results section mentions pathways like TGF-beta, Wnt, p53, etc. These are typically part of the Gene Ontology (GO) and maybe KEGG. However, the article doesn't explicitly state which gene set libraries were used for the analysis.

4. **Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - The Methods section talks about using target genes predicted by at least four algorithms but doesn't specify if they used a specific background list. Often, studies use the entire genome as the background, but without explicit mention, it's unclear here.

5. **What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis?**
   - The authors don't detail the exact statistical methods or tests used in the pathway analysis. Commonly, tools might use hypergeometric tests or others, but since they didn't specify, I can't be sure.

6. **Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis?**
   - The article doesn’t mention anything about multiple testing corrections like FDR. It’s possible they did, but without explicit information, it's not described here.

Putting this all together, most of these details aren't provided in the article. The authors focused on identifying target genes and mentioning pathways involved but didn't delve into specifics about tools, versions, gene sets, background lists, statistical tests, or corrections used.

The article does not provide specific details on the tools, versions, gene libraries, background lists, statistical tests, or corrections used in their pathway enrichment analysis.
