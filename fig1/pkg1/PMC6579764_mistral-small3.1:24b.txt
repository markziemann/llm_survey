To obtain authentic pESC, the expression of NANOG and ZFP42 is also required^[211].  FL6i-based culture
   systems^[212]. FL6i medium, which contains FGF2 and LIF, is widely used to
   sustain the pluripotency of mouse and human ESCs^[213] and human ESCs^[214]. The data in this study suggest that BMP4 is more likely to be
   TGFB, ACTIVIN and LIF^[215].

FLB2i media
   piPSC can be derived from the same way as in mouse, human
   and bovine^[216]. For the derivation of human and mouse piPSC, the combination of
   pluripotency can be derived as in mouse^[217]. For the derivation of human and
   mouse ESC, the TGFB4 is also required^[218]. The data
   is required for pluripotent^[219]. In human and mouse
   (IDs)^[220], ID2 is expressed and is required for
   pluripotency^[221], can be expressed^[222]. In the mouse and human ESC, ID2 is expressed^[223].
   The expression of ID2 is also required for the derivation of mouse and
   human ES^[224]. In the mouse, human and bovine ESC, ID2 is also required.
   The data of mouse and human pluripotency^[225].

   In the human and bovine
   here, ID2 is also required for pluripotency^[226]. However, the
   data suggest that the piPSC are in the naive-like colony
   morphology similar to mouse ESC. The data in this study indicate that
   piPSC can be obtained in the presence of BMP4^[227].
   The data of the study suggest that the pluripotency of piPSC^[228]. The data in this study suggest that the piPSC can be obtained, and
   pluripotency^[229]. The pluripotency data in this study suggest that piPSC can be
   obtained in the study. In the human and bovine ESC, this is not possible^[230].
   The data of this study suggest that ID2 is required for pluripotency in the bovine and mouse ESC^[231]. This is a pluripotent

   porcine ES cells, piPSC are generated^[233]. The pluripotency data of
   the study suggest that the pluripotency of inhibitors^[234]. The data in this study suggest that in the presence of piPSC^[235].
   The pluripotency data suggest that the expression of ID2 is required^[236]. The pluripotency data in the study suggest that

   - The article does not mention which **pathway** enrichment analysis tool or software for pathway enrichment.
   - **no** version provided.

3. **Was a gene set library used?**
   - **Answer**: Not described.
     **Explanation**: The authors do not specify which gene set library.
   - The authors provide any results validated?**
   - **Answer**: Not described.
   **Explanation**: The authors do not mention about the results validated.

### **Recommendations**

To ensure reproducibility and transparency, future studies should clearly specify the tools, libraries, and **methods, and validated results. This will help ensure the results are robust and reliable.**

### **Future Studies**

Future studies should clearly specify the tools, software, gene set library, background gene list, and validation methods. This will help ensure** the results are robust and **results?**

The article does not provide enough information to assess the validity of the results presented. Future studies should specify the pathway enrichment tools, libraries, methods, or validation results. The pathway not provide enough information to assess the validity. Future studies should clearly specify the tools, libraries, methods, or validation results.
