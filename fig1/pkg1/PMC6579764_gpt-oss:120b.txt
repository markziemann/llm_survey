Thinking...
We need to examine article for details about pathway enrichment analysis. Look at Methods section for description. In the provided text, we see Methods but not clearly separated. Search for "enrichment", "GO enrichment", "pathway enrichment". Let's scan.

In Methods section earlier (not included fully). The article contains RNAseq analysis using DESeq2, DEGs, PCA, heatmaps. There is mention of "Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was used to gain insights into the degree to which the different cell lines showed signs of differentiation." That's in Results section: "Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was used to gain insights into the degree to which the different cell lines showed signs of differentiation. (Supplementary Fig. 3)." Also they mention "Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis". They didn't specify tool. Not described. Then they also mention "We also compared the cell lines by hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes (DEGs; fold change ≥ 3, adjusted p ≤ 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 5). Here the culture conditions appeared to provide the greatest discrimination between groupings." That's not enrichment.

Later they talk about "Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis" again. No specific tool.

Search for "pathway enrichment analysis" phrase. In Results they have "c Heatmap of 54 genes of seven major signaling pathways (Notch, FGF, JAK-STAT3, WNT, p38 (MAPK14), TGFB and BMP) associated genes in each cell types". That's not enrichment.

Thus only mention is "Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis". No tool specified, no version, no library beyond GO, no custom background, no statistical test described, no multiple testing correction.

Thus answers:

- Tool used: Not described (since they didn't specify tool). But they did say "Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis". The tool is not mentioned. So "Not described".

- Version: Not described.

- Gene set libraries: GO.

- Custom background: Not described.

- Statistical test: Not described.

- Multiple testing correction: Not described.

Now need to produce table with six questions.

Let's format:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Tool used for pathway enrichment analysis | Not described |
| Enrichment tool version(s) | Not described |
| Gene set libraries used | GO |
| Custom background gene list used? | Not described |
| Statistical test(s) used | Not described |
| Multiple testing correction applied? | Not described |

Check if they used "Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis" as phrase, yes. So gene set library is GO.

Return as table.
...done thinking.

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | Not described |
| Were enrichment tool version(s) described? | Not described |
| Which gene set libraries were used? | GO |
| Custom or specific background gene list used? | Not described |
| What statistical test(s) were used in enrichment analysis? | Not described |
| Was multiple testing correction / FDR applied? | Not described |
