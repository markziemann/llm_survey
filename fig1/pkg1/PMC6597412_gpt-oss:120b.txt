Thinking...
We need to locate description of pathway enrichment analysis in Methods. Let's search the text.

Scrolling through Methods earlier: I saw "Target prediction and enrichment analysis" maybe under Methods? Actually there is a heading "Target prediction and enrichment analysis". Let's locate that part.

Scrolling: after "Target prediction and enrichment analysis" in Results they described using 9 online databases to predict target genes. Then "These genes were subjected to GO and pathway enrichment analyses". But not specific tool.

In Methods, there is a section "Target prediction and enrichment analysis" maybe. Let's search earlier.

Scrolling upward earlier: The Methods included "Target prediction and enrichment analysis" as a heading? I saw it under Results, but maybe they have it as part of Methods? In the Methods earlier there was "Target prediction and enrichment analysis" not included. Let's check.

Going back: After "Target prediction and enrichment analysis" heading appears in Results: yes there is a subheading "Target prediction and enrichment analysis" under Results. In Methods there may be a separate section but not included above. Let's examine earlier sections again: The Methods sections listed include: "Data acquisition and processing", "Differential expression analysis", "Survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis", "Cell culture", "RNA extraction and qRT-PCR", "Cell proliferation assay", "Cell apoptosis assay", "Cell migration assay", "Target prediction and enrichment analysis", "Statistical analysis". Yes there is a "Target prediction and enrichment analysis" under Methods.

We need to extract the details there.

Let's locate that text: The Methods excerpt includes:

"Target prediction and enrichment analysis

   To investigate the mechanisms underlying miR-148b-3p, miR-190b, and
   miR-429 functions, 9 online databases were scanned to predict target
   genes. We gathered target genes predicted by at least 4 algorithms to
   obtain 405 target genes for miR-148b-3p, 76 target genes for miR-190b,
   and 299 target genes for miR-429 ([100]Supplementary Table 2). These
   genes were subjected to GO and pathway enrichment analyses
   ([101]Supplementary Tables 3, [102]4, [103]5). The result revealed that
   the targets of candidate miRNAs were involved in several critical
   cancer-related pathways, including transforming growth factor
   (TGF)-beta signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, p53 pathway, p38
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and mammalian target of
   rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway ([104]Figure 6)."

So the tool used for pathway enrichment analysis is not explicitly named. It just says "GO and pathway enrichment analyses". No specific software like DAVID, GSEA. So answer "Not described".

Were enrichment tool version(s) described? No.

Which gene set libraries were used? It mentions GO (Gene Ontology) and pathways; could include pathways like TGF-beta, Wnt, p53, MAPK, mTOR. But those are pathways, not libraries like KEGG. It says "GO and pathway enrichment analyses". So gene set libraries: GO (Gene Ontology). Pathway library unspecified; could be KEGG, but not stated. So we only list GO.

Does article describe using a custom or specific background gene list? Not described.

Statistical tests used in enrichment analysis? Not described.

Multiple testing correction? Not described.

Thus produce table with six rows.

Let's list tools: Not described.

Version(s): Not described.

Gene set libraries: GO (explicit). Pathways not a library; just "pathway enrichment analyses". But not specify library like KEGG. So only GO.

Custom background: Not described.

Statistical test(s): Not described.

Multiple testing correction: No (or Not described). The question: "Was multiple testing correction / FDR applied to enrichment analysis?" Answer: No (since not mentioned). So we put "No".

Now format table.

Columns: Question, Answer.

We need to list each tool separately; but none described.

Thus:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | Not described |
| Were enrichment tool version(s) described? | Not described |
| Which gene set libraries were used? | GO |
| Does the article describe using a custom or specific background gene list for enrichment analysis? | Not described |
| What statistical test(s) were used in enrichment analysis? | Not described |
| Was multiple testing correction / FDR applied to enrichment analysis? | No |

Check if they used any tool like "DAVID". Not mentioned.

Thus final answer.
...done thinking.
