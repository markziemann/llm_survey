Abstract

   Evidences have shown a strong link between particulate matter (PM) and
   increased risk in human mortality and morbidity, including asthma,
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respiratory infection,
   and lung cancer. However, the underlying toxicologic mechanisms remain
   largely unknown. Utilizing PM-treated human pulmonary fibroblasts (HPF)
   models, we analyzed gene expression microarray data and Ingenuity
   Pathway Analysis (IPA) to identify that the transcription factor sterol
   regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) was the main downstream
   regulator of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1). Quantitative PCR and western blot
   results showed that SIRT1 inhibited SREBP1 and further downregulated
   Pirin (PIR) and Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome after
   PM exposure. Inhibitors of SIRT1, SREBP1, and PIR could reverse
   PM-induced inflammation. An in silico analysis revealed that PIR
   correlated with smoke exposure and early COPD. Immunohistochemical
   analysis of tissue microarrays from PM-fed mouse models was used to
   determine the association of PIR with PM. These data demonstrate that
   the SIRT1-SREBP1-PIR/ NLRP3 inflammasome axis may be associated with
   PM-induced adverse health issues. SIRT1 functions as a protector from
   PM exposure, whereas PIR acts as a predictor of PM-induced pulmonary
   disease. The SIRT1-SREBP1-PIR/ NLRP3 inflammasome axis may present
   several potential therapeutic targets for PM-related adverse health
   events.

INTRODUCTION

   Epidemiologic studies have suggested a strong link between air
   pollution and increased risk in human mortality and morbidity,
   including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
   pulmonary infection, and lung cancer. Meanwhile, air pollutants can
   lead to serious health consequences including stroke, Alzheimer’s
   disease, heart disease, and diabetes. Children, pregnant women, and the
   elderly are especially vulnerable [[38]1–[39]3]. World Health
   Organization (WHO) recognizes that fine particles in polluted air is an
   invisible killer responsible for around 7 million global deaths per
   year, including 43% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 29%
   from lung cancer, 25% from heart diseases, 24% from stroke, and 24%
   from acute lower respiratory infection [[40]1, [41]4].

   The sources of air pollution include industry and energy supply,
   transport, waste management, dust, agricultural practices, and
   household energy [[42]3, [43]5]. Ambient particulate matter (PM) is
   defined as airborne particles, a mixture of mixtures solid and liquid
   droplets, composed of alkanes, carbons, aromatic acids, sulfate,
   nitrate, and ions [[44]6]. Although the underlying toxicologic
   mechanisms by which PM induces adverse health events remain to be
   elucidated, it is believed that it is due to its unique
   characteristics, small size, large surface area, and ability to absorb
   a large amount of harmful molecules [[45]3]. PM is also considered as a
   potent oxidants and capable of directly generating reactive oxygen
   species (ROS), followed by cellular oxidative stress. Oxidative stress
   can activate redox-sensitive signaling pathways that lead to different
   biological cascades, including inflammation, DNA damage, and cell death
   [[46]7]. Additionally, inflammasomes, consist of caspase-1,
   apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and
   Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), imply a wide variety of chronic or
   acute inflammations, including lung disease [[47]8, [48]9]. NLRP3
   inflammasome activates caspase-1, cleaving the precursor IL-1β and
   IL-18 into bioactive cytokines, which trigger further inflammatory
   cascade [[49]8]. Several studies indicate that inflammasomes play a key
   role in PM-induced lung disease, central nervous system toxicity,
   cardiovascular disease, reproductive disorders, and skin injury [[50]8,
   [51]10–[52]13]. PM, when inhaled, easily bypasses the complete
   respiratory airway, penetrates alveoli and crosses the air-blood
   barrier, leading to increased risk in human mortality, morbidity, and
   hospitalizations, especially in COPD [[53]1–[54]3, [55]14]. In the
   current study, we sought to define the role of the inflammasome complex
   and its subsets in the pathogenesis of PM-related health problems.

   It was estimated that COPD, a progressive life-threatening lung
   disease, caused more than 3 million global deaths in 2012 [[56]15].
   Major risk factors of COPD include tobacco smoke, air pollution,
   occupational dust, chemicals, and respiratory infections [[57]15,
   [58]16]. COPD should be suspected in any patient with symptoms of
   chronic cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and/or history of exposure
   to noxious stimuli. Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung
   Disease (GOLD) guidelines for COPD state diagnosis are established by
   spirometry with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one
   second (FEV[1]) / forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0.70, consistent with
   the presence of irreversible and progressive airflow limitation
   [[59]15]. COPD can develop adverse sequelae, including pneumonia, lung
   cancer, polycythemia, hypertension, cor pulmonale, osteoporosis,
   skeletal muscle dysfunction, weight issues, sleep apnea, diabetes,
   depression, and anxiety [[60]15].

   In the current study, we hypothesized that the inflammation and tissue
   remodeling mediated by PM may arise from an alternation of gene
   expression or signaling pathways via inflammasomes, developing
   respiratory disease. We established transcriptomics data by microarray
   chips in human pulmonary fibroblasts (HPF), a central player in the
   fibrosis and airway remodeling of COPD [[61]9], after exposure to PM.
   Our results confirmed that sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1
   (SREBP1) and its downstream target Pirin (PIR) were activated by PM,
   which could be counteracted by Sirtuin1 (SIRT1). Moreover, we provided
   evidence that SREBP1 is directly inhibited by SIRT1, and increases
   expression of inflammasome-related markers in PM-treated HPF cell
   models [[62]17]. In addition, in silico analysis predicted that PIR
   played a key role in early COPD events. Taking all results into
   account, therapeutic targeting of SIRT1-SREBP1-PIR/ NLRP3-inflammasome
   axis may be a novel approach against PM-induced fibrosis and
   inflammation in the human respiratory system.

RESULTS

SREBP1 acts as the activated transcription factor upon PM treatment in HPF

   To determine the exact canonical pathways or networking induced by PM
   in the human respiratory system, we evaluated transcriptomics datasets
   by microarray chips in HPF (Human Pulmonary Fibroblast) under several
   PM groups (sham, low dose for 6 hours, low dose for 24 hours, high dose
   for 6 hours, high dose for 24 hours, low dose = 5 μM, high dose = 50
   μM) ([63]Figure 1A). Through Genespring software normalization, 732
   genes were found to have > 1.5-fold differential expression in low for
   6 hours, low for 24 hours, high for 6 hours, or high for 24 hours
   relative to sham in HPF ([64]Supplementary Table 1). The top ranking of
   candidate genes is shown in [65]Figure 1B. The normalized microarray
   data was analyzed using IPA to identify significant molecular that are
   activated in response to PM exposure in HPF. The results showed that
   the transcription factor SREBP1 was the No. 1 putative candidates to be
   activated in response to PM exposure, with the transcriptional activity
   of its downstream genes of P = 7.9E-06 in HPF. The top 7 transcription
   factors in HPF are shown in [66]Figure 1C. There are 2 SREBP genes in
   mammals, SREBP1 and SREBP2, encoding 3 sterol regulatory
   element-binding proteins (SREBPs), SREBP-1a, -1c and -2 [[67]18].
   SREBP-1a acts as a potent activator of all SREBP-responsive genes,
   stimulating cholesterol, fatty acids, and triglycerides synthesis.
   SREBP-1c is the main regulator of fatty acid, whereas SREBP-2 is the
   main regulator of cholesterol [[68]18]. We sought to study if SREBP1
   acts as transcription factors in response to PM, and our quantitative
   RT-PCR analysis result showed that SREBP1 was consistent with
   microarray in HPF ([69]Figure 2A). SREBP1 was significantly increased
   in a dose-dependent manner after PM for 6 hours and in a time-dependent
   manner after PM at low dose. We uploaded our microarray datasets into
   the SREBP1-related signature from IPA tool, and our analysis showed
   that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), interleukin 6 (IL-6),
   Pirin (PIR), Interleukin 6 Family Cytokine (LIF), and Interleukin 24
   (IL-24) were the most significantly upregulated transcriptional targets
   of SREBP1 ([70]Figure 2B).

   levels of SREBP1 downstream factors, including PIR, LIF, IL-6, IL-24,

SREBP1 activated PIR in response to PM exposure

   We further examined the levels of SREBP1 and its downstream targets,
   CXCL8, IL-6, PIR, LIF, and IL-24 in the PM treatment groups (sham, low
   for 6 hours, low for 24 hours, high for 6 hours, high for 24 hours) of
   HPF. Our quantitative RT-PCR analysis results first showed that IL-6
   and PIR were consistent with microarray in HPF, whereas CXCL8, LIF, and
   IL-24 were not consistent ([75]Figure 2C). Second, response of PIR,
   IL-24, and LIF to PM was in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Response
   of CXCL8 to PM was found to be in a dose-dependent manner and only in a
   time-dependent manner at low dose. Response of IL-6 to PM was only in a
   dose-dependent manner for 6 hours and only in a time-dependent manner
   at low dose. Therefore, we assessed the expression of PIR at the
   protein level in response to PM treatment.

   Our western blot results in the PM treatment groups (sham, low for 6
   hours, low for 24 hours, high for 6 hours, high for 24 hours) of HPF
   showed that PIR were significantly overexpressed after exposure to PM.
   PIR was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner for 6 hours
   and only in a time-dependent manner at low dose ([76]Figure 3A). At
   present, SREBP1 is a well-established negative target of SIRT1 [[77]17,
   [78]19]. We further hypothesize that PIR is negatively associated with
   SIRT1.

Increased PIR level and activity in cell culture supernatant are
significantly correlated with PM exposure

   PIR has been identified to possess enzymatic activity [[84]20].
   Moreover, delocalization of PIR was identified in melanomas [[85]20].
   To address the role of delocalization of PIR, PIR levels and PIR
   activity in cell culture supernatant of PM-induced models were
   determined. Our analysis showed that PIR enzymatic activity was
   significantly overexpressed after high-dose PM exposure ([86]Figure
   3B). Furthermore, we examined levels of SREBP1, SIRT1, and PIR in cell
   culture supernatant. Our result showed that SREBP1 and PIR were
   significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner, while SIRT1 was
   significantly suppressed in a dose-dependent manner after PM exposure,
   which was consistent with our hypothesis that PM exposure can activate
   the SREBP1-PIR axis via SIRT1 suppression ([87]Figure 3C).

PM exposure can activate the SREBP1-PIR axis, which could be suppressed by
SIRT1

   In order to validate that PM exposure can activate the SREBP1-PIR axis,
   which could be suppressed by SIRT1, we administrate the SIRT1
   inhibitors Ex527 [[88]21], SREBP1 inhibitors [89]PF429242 [[90]22], and
   PIR inhibitors TPhA [[91]23] in PM-treated HPF models. First, we
   administered [92]PF429242 (10 and 100 μM) to PM-treated HPF models, and
   mRNA level of SREBP1 was significantly decreased as expected
   ([93]Figure 3D). The mRNA level of PIR was significantly decreased in a
   dose-dependent manner in response to [94]PF429242 in PM-treated HPF
   models ([95]Figure 3E). We further examined cell culture supernatant in
   [96]PF429242-PM co-treated models, and our analysis showed that PIR
   activity was significantly inhibited by [97]PF429242 in a
   dose-dependent manner ([98]Figure 3F). These results support the
   hypothesis that the SREBP1-PIR axis was activated by PM. Second, we
   administered TPh A (50 and 100 μM) to PM-treated HPF models, and
   protein levels of PIR were significantly decreased as expected
   ([99]Figure 3G). Strikingly, the expression of SIRT1 was correlated
   with the expression of PIR on the protein levels in TPh A-PM co-treated
   HPF models ([100]Figure 3G). We further examined the cell culture
   supernatant in TPh A-PM co-treated models, and our analysis showed that
   PIR activity was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner as
   expected ([101]Figure 3H). Third, we administered Ex527 (100 μM) to
   PM-treated HPF models, and our quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that
   PIR was significantly overexpressed ([102]Figure 3I). Afterwards, we
   further performed western blot analysis. We found Ex527 (50 and 100 μM)
   suppressed the expression of SIRT1 as expected, while Ex527 increased
   the expression of PIR in a dose-dependent manner ([103]Figure 3J). Our
   analysis further showed that PIR in cell culture supernatant was
   significantly increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner in
   Ex527-PM co-treated models, which was consistent with expression on PIR
   protein level ([104]Figure 3J, [105]3K).

NLRP3 inflammasome may be activated by PM exposure via SREBP1-PIR axis

   Previous studies have identified that the protein complex called
   inflammasomes, play a central role in the acute lung injury and chronic
   pulmonary diseases [[106]8]. NLRP3 and IL-1β were considered as
   characteristic markers of inflammasomes [[107]8]. We first carried out
   quantitative RT-PCR analysis to detect the expression of NLRP3 in the 5
   PM treatment groups (sham, low for 6 hours, low for 24 hours, high for
   6 hours, high for 24 hours) of HPF, and our results showed that NLRP3
   was overexpressed in dose-dependent manner in response to PM and only
   in a time-dependent manner at low dose ([108]Figure 4A). We further
   carried out western blot to detect the expression of IL-1β and NLRP3 in
   the 5 PM treatment groups of HPF. After normalized against β-actin and
   quantified via ImageJ, NLRP3 was overexpressed in a dose-dependent
   manner for both 6 and 24 hours, while IL-1β was overexpressed in a
   dose-dependent manner for 6 hours and in a time-dependent manner at low
   dose ([109]Figure 4B). Previous studies indicate that SREBP1, directly
   deacetylated and inhibited by SIRT1, increases expression of
   inflammasomes [[110]17]. Thus, we hypothesized that exposure to PM
   suggests induction of the SREBP1-NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, via SIRT1
   inhibition. We further validated the mRNA expression of NLRP3 in
   Ex527-PM and [111]PF429242-PM co-treated HPF models. By quantitative
   RT-PCR analysis, Ex527 significantly upregulated NLPR3, while
   [112]PF429242 significantly inhibited NLRP3 in a dose-dependent manner
   ([113]Figure 4C, [114]4D). In Tph A-PM co-treated HPF models, the
   expression of PIR and SREBP1 were both downregulated in a
   dose-dependent manner, while NLRP3 was upregulated in a dose-dependent
   manner ([115]Figure 4E).

PIR acts as a biomarker for detecting early COPD

   To determine the clinical association between PIR and PM, we verified
   several previously developed microarray databases to identify and
   compare the correlation between PIR and nonsmokers, smokers, early
   COPD, and COPD using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. By
   analyzing a microarray cohort collecting small airway epithelium from
   phenotypically normal smokers and non-smokers, relative to nonsmokers,
   PIR was found to be the most activated gene to have a significant
   correlation with smoking ([119]Figure 5A-5B, P < 0.0001) ([120]GSE4498,
   n = 22). An in vitro study, assessing human airway epithelial cells,
   identified that air pollution stimulates a time- and dose- dependent
   increase in mRNA level of IL-6 via nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)
   mediated ROS [[121]24]. Moreover, a multicenter longitudinal study that
   assessed 955 myocardial infarction survivors from six European cities
   identified a strong correlation between fibrinogen beta chain (FGB) and
   IL-6 and worse outcome after exposure to air pollutions [[122]25].
   Herein, we studied whether smoke exposure could induce genetic
   expression of FGB and IL-6. Our analysis showed that FGB and IL-6 had
   no significant association with smoking ([123]Figure 5B, P = 0.0582 and
   P = 0.1572, respectively) ([124]GSE4498, n = 22). In another microarray
   database comprised of large airway epithelium from phenotypically
   normal smokers, non-smokers, early COPD, and COPD, PIR was found to
   have a strong correlation with smoking ([125]Figure 5C, [126]GSE5060, n
   = 38). We further studied whether severity of COPD was correlated with
   genetic expression of PIR, FGB, and IL-6. Notably, relative to COPD,
   PIR was found to be the most activated gene to have a significant
   correlation with early COPD ([127]Figure 5C-5D, P < 0.0001), followed
   by FGB ([128]Figure 5D, P = 0.0006), while IL-6 had no significant
   association ([129]Figure 5D, P = 0.3742) ([130]GSE5060, n = 38). In
   order to validate if PIR is far superior in detecting early COPD, we
   next identified PIR protein expression using our own clinical cohort.
   By intra-tracheal instillation of PM into lung using mice models, we
   collected tissue sections from lung to undergo pathologic exam and
   immunohistochemical examination. The immunohistochemical staining
   results showed that the PM-treated mice group had higher concentration
   of the PIR protein in the lung tissue than in the control mice group
   ([131]Figure 5E).

   immunohistochemical staining results showed PM-fed mice group had
   higher concentration of the PIR protein in the lung tissue.

   These data suggested that high PIR protein expression was significantly
   correlated with PM exposure, which means PIR acts as a predictor of
   PM-induced cardiopulmonary disease. Together, we identified that PM
   exposure can activate the SREBP1-PIR/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling
   pathway, through SIRT1 downregulation ([138]Figure 6A, [139]6B). The
   SIRT1-SREBP1-PIR/ NLRP3 inflammasome axis may present several potential
   therapeutic targets for PM-related adverse health consequence.

DISCUSSION

   PM exposure is believed to be strongly linked to systemic diseases,
   majorly cardiopulmonary diseases [[142]1, [143]4]. Alternate NF-κB
   redox-regulated signaling pathways have been identified to be a
   mediator of PM-mediated inflammation and carcinogenesis [[144]26]. PIR,
   encoded by the PIR gene, acts as an iron-dependent redox regulator of
   NF-κB. PIR is a nuclear protein detectable in all human tissues
   [[145]27]. Though the function of PIR has not been well studied, it is
   known to stabilize the formation of quaternary complexes between
   oncoprotein B-cell lymphoma 3-encoded (Bcl-3), anti-apoptotic protein
   NF-κB, and its target DNA [[146]28]. Air pollution was identified to
   activate IL-6 expression in human airway epithelial cells via NF-κB
   [[147]24], though in our analysis IL-6 had no significant association
   with smoking, whereas PIR was significantly correlated with smoking. PM
   induces adverse health events via multi-factorial mechanisms
   ([148]Supplementary Figure 1); therefore, the existence of crosstalk
   between IL-6 and PIR needs to be addressed. Several intensive
   researches in the field of cancer show that PIR may act as a relevant
   role in melanoma and acute myeloid leukemia [[149]23, [150]29]. A
   recent in vitro study demonstrated that increased expression of PIR was
   induced by smoke [[151]30], whereas another in vivo study on 13
   phenotypically normal smokers and 9 non-smokers showed that
   overexpression of PIR played a role in lung epithelial cell apoptosis
   in response to cigarette smoke [[152]28]. Surprisingly, we found that
   PIR could be a biomarker for detecting early COPD. The lack of
   overexpression of PIR in COPD was surprising because PIR-related
   apoptosis was thought to result COPD [[153]28]. In contrast to our
   result however, upregulation of PIR from the human small airway
   epithelium (n = 33) was consistent with the pathogenesis of COPD
   [[154]31]. Indeed it was previously documented that tobacco-induced
   emphysema was independent of NF-κB [[155]32]. Reduction of PIR was
   detected in neonatal mouse respiratory distress disease by cDNA
   microarray analysis [[156]33]. The plausible explanation is that COPD
   is a multifactorial and complex disease, involved in variety of factors
   and cells [[157]15], the inhibition or inactivation of PIR in each
   stage of COPD need further elucidated.

   Previous in vitro and in vivo researches suggest that SIRT1 negatively
   regulates NF-κB-proinflammatory axis in lung disease, including COPD
   and allergic asthma [[158]34]. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated
   that SIRT1 functions as a protector from inflammation and coagulation
   via modulating NF-κB activation following PM exposure [[159]35]. The
   mechanism of SIRT1 regulation in response to PM, nevertheless, remains
   to be elucidated. Our data showed that PM inhibited SIRT1 activity,
   which confirmed the protective role of SIRT1 in response to PM. A
   feedback loop between SIRT1 and NF-κB had been documented [[160]36].
   SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels as well as SIRT1 promoter activity
   upregulated in NF-κB overexpression cell models, while SIRT1 protein
   expression and SIRT1 promoter activity decreased in NF-κB knockdown
   cell models. Our results revealed that the expression of SIRT1 was
   correlated with the expression of PIR at the protein levels in TPh A-PM
   co-treated HPF models ([161]Figure 3G), which supported the hypothesis
   that SIRT1 may interact with NF-κB inflammation via PIR. Our results
   further revealed that PM exposure can activate SREBP1-PIR signaling
   pathway through SIRT1 downregulation. Therefore, SIRT1 may interfere
   with NF-κB inflammation via the SREBP1-PIR signaling pathway.

   In addition to disrupting inflammation, recent studies demonstrated
   that SIRT1 inhibits NF-κB to suppress various metabolic diseases,
   including glucose homeostasis and cardiovascular disease [[162]35,
   [163]37]. However, the crosstalk controlling metabolism between SIRT1
   and NF-κB remains unclear. Several in vitro studies revealed that
   SIRT1-SREBP1 protect mice from hepatic lipogenesis [[164]19, [165]38].
   A study showed that fenofibrate, clinically used to reduce lipid
   levels, prevented rabbits with atrial fibrillation from atrial
   metabolic remodeling through the SIRT1-SREBP1 pathway [[166]39].
   Another study showed that fenofibrate regulated hyperglycemia-induced
   metabolic memory via SIRT1-dependent suppression of NF-κB in human
   retinal endothelial cells [[167]40]. In addition, fenofibrate inhibited
   the inflammatory response via SIRT1-dependent suppression of NF-κB in
   adipocytes [[168]41]. On the basis of previous work and this study,
   SIRT1 may acts as a protector from PM-related consequences, including
   cardiopulmonary and metabolic disease, by interfering in NF-κB
   inflammation via SREBP1-PIR signaling pathway. Interestingly, both in
   vitro and in vivo experiments documented that NF-κB-mediated activation
   of SREBP1 pathway increased lipid biosynthesis through binding to
   promoter region [[169]42]. Previously studies have also claimed that
   PIR acts as a cofactor for NF-κB activity [[170]27], which was
   consistent with our observation that both the total form and
   phosphorylation form of NF-κB were inhibited in TPh A-PM co-treated HPF
   models ([171]Supplementary Figure 2). Our results revealed the
   expression SREBP1 were downregulated in a dose-dependent manner in Tph
   A-PM co-treated HPF models ([172]Figure 4E), which supported the
   positive feedback loop between SREBP1 and NF-κB quaternary complexes
   ([173]Figure 6A).

   Several studies indicate that NLRP3 inflammasome activation played a
   key role in PM-induced lung disease, mediated by NF-κB [[174]10].
   However in our study, Tph A, reducing the binding affinity between PIR
   and Bcl3 in NF-κB quaternary complexes, upregulated NLRP3 protein
   expression in a dose-dependent manner in PM-treated HPF models, which
   suggested that NLRP3 inflammasome promoted PM-induced adverse health
   events without dependence on NF-κB quaternary complexes [[175]23].
   Furthermore, in vivo evidence from translational studies indicated that
   the dysregulation of SIRT1-SREBP-NLRP3 inflammasome may contribute to
   atherosclerosis [[176]17]. Based on previous evidence and on our
   results, SIRT1-SREBP1-inflammasomes is another plausible axis in
   response to PM.

   Exposure to PM was responsible for high mortality. Of the number of
   global deaths in specific disease categories, COPD was attributed as
   the leading cause of death by air pollution and is already the 3^rd
   leading cause of deaths worldwide [[177]43]. COPD is characterized by
   predominantly pulmonary infiltration inflammatory cells, including
   macrophages, neutrophils, and T lymphocytes [[178]15]. These
   inflammatory cells, together with structure cells, including epithelial
   and endothelial cells and fibroblasts, release multiple inflammatory
   mediators, including chemokines, inflammasomes, cytokines, free
   radicles, lipid mediators, protease, and growth factors, amplifying the
   inflammatory cascade and triggering airway remodeling [[179]44]. Lung
   function tests assess the severity of disease in COPD. However,
   biomarkers have been sought for diagnosis, disease progression,
   exacerbation risk, and therapeutic response [[180]45]. In 2009, SIN and
   VESTBO reviewed the current candidate plasma or serum biomarkers linked
   to COPD and found that the systematic inflammatory mediators most
   associated with COPD outcomes were fibrinogen and C-reactive protein
   (CRP) [[181]46]. There have been further conflicting reports in large
   COPD cohorts [[182]47]. IL-6, leading to a rise in plasma fibrinogen
   and CRP, was significantly raised in COPD and elevated during
   exacerbations in the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify
   Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) cohort [[183]48]. Conversely, our
   quantitative RT-PCR results showed that IL-6 responded only in a
   dose-dependent manner for 6 hours and in a time-dependent manner at low
   dose ([184]Figure 2C), while our in silico analysis showed that IL-6
   had no significant association with COPD ([185]Figure 5D, P = 0.3742)
   ([186]GSE5060, n = 38). Ilumets et al. reported that matrix
   metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) in induced sputum and plasma appeared to
   be overexpressed in smokers [[187]49]. However, in humans, steroid
   therapy showed no effect on MMP-9 levels [[188]50]. Ilumets et al. also
   mentioned that MMP-8 in the sputum distinguished individuals with
   asymptomatic COPD, at risk of developing COPD, from healthy smokers,
   while Sng et al. reported a negative correlation between MMP-8 with
   exhaled breath condensate in COPD patients when compared to healthy
   controls [[189]49, [190]51]. Several clinical trials demonstrated that
   higher blood eosinophil counts may present increased exacerbation
   frequency and predict better medicine response [[191]15]. Ichikawa et
   al. indicated that SIRT1 decreased in lung tissue coupled with
   inflammatory cell infiltration, eosinophilia, and cytokine production
   in an asthmatic mouse model [[192]52]. Together, PIR may serve as a
   sensitive biomarker for early stage cardiopulmonary disease elicited by
   COPD and a predictor for medicine response. However, the importance and
   specific role of SIRT1 in modulating eosinophil activity remains
   unidentified. Additionally, further studies are needed to clarify if
   PIR could be a biomarker for assessing the outcome of COPD.

   In summary, our studies demonstrate that SIRT1 modulates the
   SREBP1-PIR/NLRP3 inflammasome axis in response to PM, indicating that
   the SIRT1-SREBP1-PIR/ NLRP3 inflammasome axis may be associated to
   adverse health issues. SIRT1 functions as a protector from PM exposure,
   whereas PIR acts as a predictor of PM-induced cardiopulmonary disease.
   The SIRT1-SREBP1-PIR/ NLRP3 inflammasome axis may present an attractive
   therapeutic target for PM-related adverse health events.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

PM

   We purchased urban dust from Urban dust (1649b, NIST® SRM®,
   Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The dried PM samples were diluted with
   sterilized phosphate-buVered saline solution (PBS, pH 7.2) and then
   frozen at −80 C prior to use.

PM treatment

   After reviewing the literature [[193]53], we chose 5 μM PM as low dose
   and 50 μM as high dose. HPF was incubated with PM 5 μM, 50 μM, or sham
   for 6 hours and 24 hours. We estimated the global RNA expression for
   extra 6 hours, which is the optimal time point at which mRNAs and genes
   are fully transcribed by PM treatments. After PM incubation for 6 or 24
   hours, we extracted HPF RNA and performed Affymetrix u133 plus 2.0 cDNA
   microarrays to detect the global and pre-defined gene and mRNA probe
   changes at the specific time points.

Cell culture and reagents

   Human pulmonary fibroblasts (HPF) were purchased from ScienCell
   research laboratories (Cat. #3300, ScienCell, Carlsbad CA, USA). They
   were grown in fibroblast medium (FM, Cat. #2301, ScienCell, Carlsbad
   CA, USA) and stored at 37 °C and 5% CO[2]. The medium was supplemented
   with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Cat. #0010, ScienCell, Carlsbad CA,
   USA), 1% growth supplement (FGS; Cat. #2352, ScienCell, Carlsbad CA,
   USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (P/S; Cat. #0503,
   ScienCell, Carlsbad CA, USA).

Reagents and compounds

   Reagents used for the in vitro culture system include Ex527 (Cat.
   #E7034, Sigma-Aldrich®, Deisenhofen, Germany), [194]PF429242 (Cat.
   #3354, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), TPh A (Cat. #TPh A ab144376,
   Abcam®, Cambridge, MA, USA), and Human Pirin ELISA Kit (Cat.
   #MBS280347, MyBioSource, San Diego CA, USA).

RT-qPCR

   Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
   according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The RNA was quantified by
   NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). Reverse
   transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and nested RT-PCR amplification were
   performed with a SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
   according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The expression level of
   Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was predominantly used
   as an internal standard for RT-PCR. The specific primer sequences are
   as follows: SREBP1 forward is 5′–GCAAGGCCATCGACTACATT-3′ and reverse is
   5’-GGTCAGTGTGTCCTCCACCT-3′, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8)
   forward is 5′-ATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTGGCT-3′ and reverse is
   5′-TCTCAGCCCTCTTCAAAAACTTCTC-3′, interleukin 6 (IL-6) forward is
   5′-GGTACATCCTCGACGGCATCT-3′ and reverse is 5′-GCCTCTTTGCTGCTTTCAC-3′,
   Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) forward is
   5′-CTTCTCTGATGAGGCCCAAG-3′ and reverse is 5′- GCAGCAAACTGGAAAGGAAG-3′,
   interleukin 24 (IL-24) forward is 5′-TGTGAAAGACACTATGCAAGCTC-3′ and
   reverse is 5′-GTGACACGATGAGAACAAAGTTG-3′, Interleukin 6 Family Cytokine
   (LIF) forward is 5′-CCAACGTGACGGACTTCCC-3′ and reverse is
   5′-TACACGACTATGCGGTACAGC-3′, and PIR forward is
   5′-GAGCAGTCGGAAGGGGTTG-3′ and reverse is 5′-TTAACTCGGGTCTGCCAATGC-3′.

Western-blot analysis

   Western blot analysis was performed with primary anti-PIR antibody
   (GeneTex, Irvine CA, USA), anti-NLRP3 antibody (GeneTex, Irvine, CA,
   USA), anti-SREBP1 antibody (GeneTex, Irvine CA, USA), anti-IL-6
   antibody (Abcam, Cambridge MA, USA), anti-IL-1β antibody (GeneTex,
   Irvine, CA, USA), anti-SIRT1 antibody (Proteintech®, Rosemont, USA),
   and anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The
   bands corresponding to western blot were quantified using ImageJ.

RNA microarray analysis

   Total RNA was corresponding extracted and purified from HPF samples via
   RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen®, Valencia CA, USA) as the initial material and
   then qualified by Agilent model 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
   Palo Alto CA, USA). All RNA samples were labeled with the GeneChip
   3′IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara CA, USA), hybridized,
   washed, and scanned to the arrays with GeneAtlas Hybridization, Wash,
   and Stain Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara CA, USA), as described by the
   manufacturer. Normalization genes were identically represented on the
   GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara CA,
   USA). Expression of genes was then generated after log2 transformation
   and normalization with GeneSpring software (Agilent Technologies, Palo
   Alto CA, USA). To uncover the significance of genes for further
   analysis, cutoff values for gene expression results greater than ±
   1.5-fold-change were further overlaid onto Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
   (IPA; QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) to estimate canonical pathways,
   downstream effects, and potential upstream regulators. in response to
   PM.

In vivo model

   6-8-week-old nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient gamma
   (NOD.Cg-Prkdc^scid Il2rg^tm1Wjl/SzJ, NOD-SCID γ, NSG™, JAX®, Harbor ME,
   USA) male mice (20-25 g body weight) and B6.Cg-Lep ^ob/J (B6 ob JAX®,
   Harbor ME, USA) were used. To establish in vivo PM model, PM particles
   were diluted with 10 μl of PBS and then intratracheally administered
   into the pulmonary regions with Hamilton syringe. Body weight and
   behavior were monitored weekly.

Immunohistochemistry staining analysis

   Briefly, tissue sections (5 μm) were dewaxed and rehydrated. The slides
   were incubated in 10 mmol/L citric buffer (pH 6.0). Antigen retrieval
   was done in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) and microwaved for 15 minutes.
   Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by placing the sections in a
   methanol bath containing 0.5% H[2]O[2]. After blocking as above, the
   slides were incubated with primary antibody against target proteins,
   followed by biotin-conjugated secondary antibody polymer-HRP reagent
   The endogenous peroxidase activity was then visualized with
   diaminobenzidine tetrahydroxychloride (DAB) solution.

Public database

   Analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), a public cohort microarray
   database, was used to validate the correlation between expression of
   biomarkers and PM. The differentially expressed genes in the dataset
   were determined by nonparametric and t-test analysis.

Statistical analysis

   Statistics analysis was performed with SPSS 17.0 software for Windows
   (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). P < 0.05 on a two-sided test was
   considered significant.

Ethics approval

   Animal care and experiments were performed in compliance with 3R
   principles and approved by the Academia Sinica Institutional Animal
   Care and Utilization Committee (IACUC).
