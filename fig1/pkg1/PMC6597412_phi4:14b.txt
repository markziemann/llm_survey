Here is an analysis based on the provided text regarding how the pathway enrichment analysis was conducted:

1. **Tool Used for Pathway Enrichment Analysis:**  
   Not explicitly described. The text mentions "9 online databases" and target gene prediction but does not specify which tool(s) were used specifically for pathway enrichment.

2. **Tool Version Number Provided:**  
   No version number is provided in the text.

3. **Gene Set Library Queried:**  
   The specific libraries are not described, but it mentions involvement of critical cancer-related biological processes and pathways like TGF-beta signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, p53 pathway, p38 MAPK pathway, and mTOR signaling pathway. These suggest a broad range that might include databases like KEGG or others typically used in such analyses.

4. **Background Gene List Defined:**  
   Not described. The text does not specify if there was a defined background gene list for the analysis.

5. **Statistical Test Used for Enrichment Analysis:**  
   Not described. The specific statistical test(s) used are not detailed in the provided information.

6. **False Discovery Rate Correction Used:**  
   Not explicitly mentioned. There is no indication of whether false discovery rate correction was applied to control false positives.

This table summarizes the details:
