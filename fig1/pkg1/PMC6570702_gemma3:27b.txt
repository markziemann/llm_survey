Here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis methods described in the provided text, formatted for a table:

| **Question** | **Answer** |
|---|---|
| 1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | DAVID (not explicitly stated, but implied as itâ€™s the common tool for this type of analysis and the results align with typical DAVID output) |
| 2. Was a tool version number provided? | Not described |
| 3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)? | KEGG and GO (both used) |
| 4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis? | Not described |
| 5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis? | Not described |
| 6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis? | Yes, false discovery rate (FDR) correction was used. |

**Important Notes:**

*   The article doesn't provide *detailed* methodological information regarding pathway enrichment. It only broadly states *that* analyses were performed.
*   I've made some inferences (e.g., the likely use of DAVID) based on common practices in bioinformatics, but these are not explicitly stated in the text.
* The exact statistical test is not stated.
