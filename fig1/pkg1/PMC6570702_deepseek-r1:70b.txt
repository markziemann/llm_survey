Alright, so I need to figure out how the pathway enrichment analysis was conducted in this scientific article. Let's start by looking through the information provided.

First, under the Results section, it mentions that GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed using DAVID. So, that answers question 1: the tool used is DAVID. I don't see any version number mentioned for DAVID, so question 2 would be no.

Next, they specifically state that both GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) were the gene set libraries queried, which covers question 3.

For question 4, the article says they used differentially expressed genes as the background. That makes sense because pathway analysis typically requires a list of significant genes to compare against a background set.

Regarding the statistical test in question 5, DAVID usually uses a modified Fisher's exact test or the EASE score, which is a variant of the Fisher's exact test. Since it's not explicitly mentioned here, I might need to infer based on standard practices, but since the article doesn't specify, I should note that it's not described.

Finally, for question 6 about false discovery rate (FDR) correction, the text doesn't mention whether they used FDR or another method like Bonferroni correction. So, I'll have to say that it's not described as well.

The pathway enrichment analysis in the article was conducted using DAVID, without specifying a version number. The gene sets queried were GO and KEGG. A background gene list of differentially expressed genes was used. The specific statistical test employed isn't detailed, nor is there mention of FDR correction.

| **Tool Used**       | DAVID                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Version Number**  | Not described                            |
| **Gene Set Library**| GO (Gene Ontology), KEGG                 |
| **Background Gene List**| Differentially expressed genes        |
| **Statistical Test**| Not described                            |
| **FDR Correction**  | Not described                            |

This table summarizes the information available from the article regarding pathway enrichment analysis.
