Here's a breakdown of the pathway enrichment analysis methods used in the provided text, presented in a table-ready format.

| **Question** | **Answer** |
|---|---|
| 1. What tool was used for pathway enrichment analysis? | Database for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) |
| 2. Was a tool version number provided? | Not described |
| 3. What gene set library was queried (eg: GO, KEGG, Reactome or other)? | KEGG |
| 4. Was a background gene list defined for pathway enrichment analysis? | Yes, differentially expressed genes were used as the query gene list, and it is implied that all genes in the study comprised the background list. |
| 5. What statistical test was used for enrichment analysis? | Not described |
| 6. Was false discovery rate correction used to control the number of false positives in the pathway enrichment analysis? | Yes, P-value was used as a threshold and pathways with P<0.05 were considered statistically significant.|

**Important Notes & Caveats:**

*   The level of detail regarding the pathway enrichment analysis is limited. The authors do not explicitly state *how* the enrichment was performed beyond stating they used KEGG.
*   It's unclear if any specific statistical software was used to perform the analysis.
*   Details about the exact statistical method used to calculate the p-values are missing.
*   It's also not clear how the list of differentially expressed genes was generated (e.g., which statistical test and criteria were used).
