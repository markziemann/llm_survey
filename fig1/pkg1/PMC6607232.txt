Abstract

   Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is a relatively rare but terminal
   malignancy, and drug/chemical development is an important aspect of
   prevention and treatment of GBC. Ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic
   triterpenoid, has been reported to exhibit various pharmaceutical
   effects. In the present study, the antiproliferative and anti-invasive
   effects of UA and the associated mechanisms in GBC were examined. UA
   was isolated from Isodon excisoides. The GBC cells (GBC-SD and NOZ)
   were treated with UA and subjected to a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The
   GBC-SD cells were subsequently selected for an Annexin V-FITC/propidium
   iodide assay, Transwell chamber assay, RT^2 profiler polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) array and western blot analysis. The results indicated
   that UA inhibited the proliferation and invasion and induced the
   apoptosis of GBC-SD cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the
   PCR arrays demonstrated that there were 24 differentially expressed
   genes between the UA-treated and untreated groups. These differentially
   expressed genes suggested that UA induced the apoptosis of GBC-SD cells
   through activation of the cell extrinsic pathway. According to Kyoto
   Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of these
   differentially expressed genes, the suppression of nuclear factor
   (NF)-κB and protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathways was further
   validated. In summary, UA induces the apoptosis and inhibits the
   invasion of GBC-SD cells, which may be associated with the suppression
   of NF-κB and Akt signaling pathways. These results may offer a
   potential therapeutic strategy for the chemoprevention or chemotherapy
   of GBC in humans.

Introduction

   Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is the most common malignant tumor of the
   biliary tract and one of the common malignant tumor types of the
   gastrointestinal tract ([40]1). GBC is infrequent in the majority of
   developed countries, but common in certain specific geographical
   regions of developing countries, including northern India, South
   Karachi in Pakistan and eastern Europe ([41]2). GBC is characterized by
   late diagnosis, metastasis and recurrence which occur readily, and poor
   prognosis and survival rates ([42]2–[43]4). Surgery is considered the
   only curative therapy for GBC. However, at diagnosis, <20% of patients
   are suitable candidates for surgical treatment ([44]4). GBC should be
   treated with systemic chemotherapy, and drug/chemical development is
   important for the prevention and treatment of GBC.

   Antitumor promotion with phytochemicals is currently regarded as an
   efficient and reliable strategy for cancer chemoprevention and therapy.
   The genus Isodon (formerly Rabdosia) comprising ~150 species of
   undershrubs, subundershrubs and perennial herbs, is found throughout
   the world, primarily in tropical and subtropical Asia ([45]5). Several
   Isodon species are widely used in popular Chinese folk medicine for the
   treatment of bacterial infections, inflammation, cancer and
   hepatotoxicity ([46]5). A large number of secondary metabolites with
   diverse biological activities have been isolated from this species.
   These chemical constituents include diterpenoids, triterpenoids and
   flavonoids ([47]6–[48]8). In the present study, ursolic acid (UA;
   [49]Fig. 1A), a pentacyclic triterpenoid, was isolated from Isodon
   excisoides. UA has been reported to exhibit various pharmaceutical
   effects, including anticancer, antiangiogenic, antioxidant,
   anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective,
   antihyperlipidemic and hypoglycemic activities, among others
   ([50]9,[51]10). The anticancer effects of UA are mediated by
   suppression of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B
   (Akt), nuclear factor (NF)-κB and signal transducer and activator of
   transcription 3 pathways with their regulated gene products, including
   cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, myeloid cell leukemia-1 and
   vascular endothelial growth factor ([52]11). In addition, He et al
   ([53]12) reported that there were 611 proteins possibly interacting
   with UA and >49 functional clusters responding to UA. Numerous studies
   have suggested that UA is a promising sensitizer for cancer therapy
   ([54]11). Previous evidence has revealed that UA inhibits the growth of
   GBC cells through inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis ([55]13).
   However, the anti-invasive effect of UA and the associated mechanism in
   GBC remain to be fully elucidated. Therefore, the present study aimed
   to investigate the antiproliferative and anti-invasive effects of
   purified UA in the GBC-SD human GBC cell line in vitro. The results
   will assist in expanding current understanding of the anticancer effect
   and mechanism of UA. Furthermore, the results may contribute to the
   development of UA as a potent anticancer agent for GBC.

Extraction, isolation and purification of UA from I. excisoides

   The dried and powdered aerial parts of I. excisoides (3 kg) were
   extracted with anhydrous ether (12 L). The extract was then filtered
   and evaporated in a rotatory evaporator under reduced pressure. The
   concentrated residue (89 g) was dissolved in methanol (3.6 L) and
   activated carbon (108 g) was added. The mixture was heated under reflux
   and further filtered and evaporated to produce a crude product (71 g).
   The crude product was then successively separated by silica gel
   chromatographic column and Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, giving
   a compound (56 mg). This compound was identified as UA on the basis of
   its mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. UA (ursolic acid,
   C[30]H[48]O[3]): HR-EIMS m/z 456.3608 (456.3603 calcd. for

Cell culture and UA treatment

   The GBC-SD and NOZ cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 or high-glucose
   DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37°C in a 5% CO[2] humidified
   atmosphere, and routinely passaged at 2–3-day intervals. UA was
   dissolved in DMSO to a 50 mM stock concentration. The final DMSO
   concentration was accounted for ≤0.1% (v/v). DMSO (0.05%)-treated cells
   were used as a vehicle control.

Cell viability assay

   A CCK-8 assay was performed to evaluate the effect of UA on cell
   viability. A total of 1.2×10^4 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates
   overnight and then treated with varying concentrations of UA (0, 10,
   20, 30, 40, 45 and 50 µM). The cells were incubated for either 24 or 48
   h at 37°C in a humidified incubator, following which 10 µl CCK-8
   solution was added into each well and incubated for a further 1 h. The
   absorbance was measured at 450 nm in each well using a microplate
   spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). The
   results are presented as the mean values of three independent
   experiments performed over multiple days. Cell viability was calculated
   using the following formula: Cell viability (%)=[optical density (OD)
   of the experiment samples/OD of the control] × 100%. The half maximal
   inhibitory concentration (IC[50]) value of UA against the GBC-SD or NOZ
   cells was calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc.,
   La Jolla, CA, USA).

Apoptosis assays

   Cell apoptosis was detected using an Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis
   Detection kit. In brief, the cells from the UA-treated (10, 30 and 50
   µM) and untreated groups were seeded in 6-well plates (1×10^6
   cells/well) and cultured for 24 h. The cells were collected, washed
   with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in binding buffer at a cell density
   of 1×10^6 cells/ml. The cells were stained with 5 µl Annexin V-FITC and
   10 µl PI (20 µg/ml) and then incubated in the dark at 25°C for 15 min.
   Apoptotic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (CytoFlex; Beckman
   Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA). The percentage of apoptotic cells was
   analyzed using FlowJo software (version 9.8.3, FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR,
   USA). The experiments were repeated three times.

Cell invasion assay

   A cell invasion assay was performed using 8-µm pore size Transwell
   chambers. The upper side of the Transwell filter inserts was coated
   with 80 µl diluted (1:8 in serum-free medium) Matrigel in 24-well
   plates. The GBC-SD cells at a density of 1×10^5 cells/well were
   suspended in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium and added to the upper
   chambers containing various concentrations of UA (10, 30 and 50 µM).
   The lower chambers were filled with 500 µl RPMI-1640 medium containing
   20% FBS. After 24 h, the non-invaded cells were removed, and the
   invasive cells were fixed with 95% ethanol, stained with 0.1% crystal
   violet and images were captured (magnification, ×100) with a light
   microscope (XDS-1B inverted biological microscope, Chongqing Optical &
   Electrical Instrument Co., Ltd., Chongqing, China). The assay was
   repeated in three independent experiments.

RT^2 profiler PCR arrays for apoptosis and invasion

   In brief, cells from the UA-treated (50 µM) and untreated groups were
   seeded in 6-well plates (1×10^6 cells/well) and cultured for 24 h.
   Total RNA was extracted from each experimental group using TRIzol
   reagent and quantified by spectrophotometry. Subsequently, 1 µg of
   total RNA was reverse transcribed with the PrimeScript™ RT Reagent kit,
   according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT^2 Profiler ‘human
   apoptosis’ PCR arrays and RT^2 Profiler ‘human extracellular matrix and
   adhesion molecules’ PCR arrays were performed in duplicate according to
   the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR was performed as follows: 10 min
   at 95°C and 40 cycles (15 sec at 95°C, 1 min at 60°C). The specificity
   of the SYBR Green assay was confirmed by melting curve analysis.
   Relative fold changes in mRNA levels were calculated following
   normalization to housekeeping control gene targets using the
   comparative Cq method ([58]14).

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis

   In order to investigate the signaling pathways that may be involved in
   the effects of UA on GBC-SD cells, KEGG pathway analysis of
   differentially expressed genes was performed using the Database for
   Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
   ([59]https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) ([60]15,[61]16). Pathway terms with
   P<0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Western blot analysis

   Following treatment with UA (0, 10, 30 and 50 µM) for 6 h, the GBC-SD
   cells were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer. Based on
   total protein concentrations calculated from the BCA assays, the total
   cell lysates (15 µg total protein) were separated via SDS-PAGE (8% gel)
   and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in a
   standard transfer buffer. Following blocking with 1% BSA (blocking
   solution) for 1.5 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated
   with primary antibodies to phospho-NF-κB p65 (Ser536; 1:1,000), NF-κB
   p65 (1:1,000), phospho-Akt (Ser473; 1:1,000), Akt (1:1,000) or GAPDH
   (1:5,000) overnight at 4°C. The membranes were washed three times with
   TBST and then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
   (1:5,000; cat. no. SA00001-1/SA00001-2; ProteinTech Group, Inc.,
   Chicago, IL, USA) for 2 h at room temperature. Following extensive
   washing in TBST, the protein signals were visualized using enhanced
   chemiluminescence (ECL) western blotting substrate (cat. no. B500014;
   ProteinTech Group, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and an ECL system (Bio-Rad
   Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Equal protein loading was
   assessed by normalizing against the expression of GAPDH. Quantification
   of protein bands densitometry was carried out using ImageJ software
   (version 1.8.0_112; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Statistical analysis

   All data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical
   analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
   Groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance. P<0.05 was
   considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

Results

Structural determination of UA isolated from I. excisoides and cell viability
assay

   Consistent with previous results ([62]17,[63]18), UA was isolated from
   an Isodon species (I. excisoides). UA was identified by comparison of
   its HR-EIMS, ^1H-NMR and ^13C-NMR spectra data with those previously
   reported for UA ([64]19,[65]20), and to an authentic sample
   (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany). The proliferation
   inhibition effect of UA on GBC-SD and NOZ cells was determined using a
   CCK-8 assay. Within the dose range and time period measured, UA was
   able to inhibit cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner
   ([66]Fig. 1B and C). Furthermore, the IC[50] values of UA at the same
   exposure time for GBC-SD cells were marginally lower compared with
   those for NOZ cells. The IC[50] values for GBC-SD cells at 24 and 48 h
   were 57.44 and 39.12 µM, respectively, and the values for NOZ cells
   were 61.58 and 41.81 µM, respectively. Therefore, GBC-SD cells were
   selected to further investigate the effect of UA on the invasive
   capacity of GBC cells. In addition, the IC[50] value for GBC-SD cells
   at 48 h was lower than that reported in the literature (for example,
   the IC[50] value for GBC-SD cells at 48 h was previously reported to be
   47.6 µM) ([67]13), which may derive from differences in experimental
   design and operation.

UA induces apoptosis of GBC-SD cells in a dose-dependent manner

   The UA-induced apoptosis of GBC-SD cells was determined using an
   Annexin V-FITC/PI assay. As indicated in [68]Fig. 1D and E, UA
   treatment increased the apoptosis of GBC-SD cells in a dose-dependent
   manner. The apoptotic rates of the cells were 11.98, 17.37 and 55.50%
   following treatment with 10, 30 and 50 µM UA, respectively, which were
   all increased compared with the apoptotic rate of GBC-SD cells cultured
   under normal conditions (9.96%). The apoptotic rates of GBC-SD cells in
   the middle (30 µM) and high (50 µM) dose groups were statistically
   significant (P<0.05). UA (10, 30 or 50 µM) treatment had no significant
   effect on the distribution of GBC-SD cells in the cell cycle (data not
   shown). These results indicate that UA inhibits GBC-SD cell
   proliferation by inducing apoptosis.

UA inhibits the invasion of GBC-SD cells in a dose-dependent manner

   Cell invasion is a driving force in the process of tumor metastasis
   formation. Therefore, the effects of UA on invasion in GBC-SD cells was
   evaluated ([69]Fig. 2A and B). The in vitro invasion assay indicated
   that UA at concentrations of 10–50 µM significantly reduced the rate of
   GBC-SD cell invasion when compared with the control group following
   cell treatment for 24 h (P<0.01). Furthermore, UA at concentrations of
   10 and 30 µM did not significantly reduce the viability of GBC-SD cells
   following cell treatment for 24 h ([70]Fig. 1B). These results
   suggested that the inhibition of GBC-SD cell invasion by UA did not
   result from a reduction of cell viability. These observations suggested
   that UA was able to regulate the invasive capacity of GBC-SD cells in a
   dose-dependent manner.

   by western blotting. GAPDH was used as the sample loading control.
   Quantification of protein bands densitometry was carried out using
   ImageJ software. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation

Effects of UA on GBC-SD cells are at least in part via NF-κB and Akt
signaling pathways

   As UA induced apoptosis and inhibited invasion in GBC-SD cells, the
   expression of 168 key genes involved in these two processes was
   subsequently evaluated with a PCR array. The cells were incubated with
   UA (50 µM) for 24 h, and 168 related genes (84 apoptosis-related genes
   and 84 adhesion/invasion-related genes) were analyzed, compared with
   untreated GBC-SD cells. Of these 168 genes, there were 24 with log[2]
   fold change values of either >1.5 or ≥1.5, which were considered
   differentially expressed ([73]Table I). Of these 24 genes, eight
   apoptosis-related genes were screened. Of these eight genes, three
   genes encoding pro-apoptotic members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
   family, including TNF (log[2] fold change: 3.17), lymphotoxin-α (log[2]
   fold change: 2.19) and CD27 (log[2] fold change: 3.56) were enhanced in
   the UA-treated GBC-SD cells compared with the control groups ([74]Table
   I). Therefore, these results suggested that UA induces apoptosis in
   GBC-SD cells through activation of the cell extrinsic pathway, which is
   initiated by members of the TNF superfamily ([75]21,[76]22). TNF is
   able to trigger either the formation of complex-I, driving the
   activation of NF-κB and an inflammatory response, or the formation of
   complex-II, which can trigger apoptosis ([77]23). Of the 24
   differentially expressed genes, a further 16 adhesion/invasion-related
   genes were screened out, including nine upregulated and seven
   downregulated genes. These upregulated and downregulated genes may have
   multiple effects on the invasion of GBC-SD cells. KEGG pathway analysis
   of the 24 differentially expressed genes was performed using the
   Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
   ([78]15,[79]16). According to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, the
   differentially expressed genes were significantly associated with
   NF-κB, TNF, PI3K-Akt and other signaling pathways ([80]Table II). To
   determine whether UA regulates the NF-κB and Akt signaling pathways,
   the effect of UA on the expression and activation of proteins in these
   signaling pathways was detected by western blotting. As shown in
   [81]Fig. 2C, the GBC-SD cells treated with UA exhibited a significant
   and dose-dependent reduction in total NF-κB p65 and Akt, and a marginal
   decrease in total p-NF-κB p65 (Ser536) and p-Akt (Ser473). Therefore,
   it was demonstrated that the effects of UA on GBC-SD cells were, at
   least in part, mediated through the NF-κB and Akt signaling pathways.

Discussion

   UA is a pentacyclic triterpenoid widely found in the plant kingdom. It
   has attracted attention in recent years due to it numerous activities
   and low toxicity ([110]10). It exerts anticancer effects in various
   cancer cell lines ([111]24), and inhibits the growth of GBC cells
   through inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis ([112]13). The present
   study identified that low doses of UA (10, 30 and 50 µM) did not affect
   cell cycle but induced cell apoptosis in GBC-SD cells. In addition,
   previous studies have reported that UA can cause cell death by
   autophagy or necrosis ([113]25,[114]26). These results indicate that UA
   inhibits GBC-SD cell proliferation primarily by inducing cell death via
   apoptosis, and possibly also via autophagy or necrosis. To the best of
   our knowledge, no previous studies have reported the anti-invasive
   effect of UA on GBC. It was identified in the present study that UA
   significantly reduced the rate of GBC-SD cell invasion. Furthermore,
   the effects of UA on GBC-SD cells were at least partly mediated via the
   suppression of NF-κB and Akt signaling pathways.

   The anticancer mechanism of UA is complex and multifaceted. The results
   of the present study suggested that UA induced the apoptosis of GBC-SD
   cells through activation of the cell extrinsic pathway. However, a
   previous study demonstrated that activation of the
   mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway is also involved in UA-induced
   GBC-SD cell apoptosis ([115]13). Another study on gastrointestinal
   cancer demonstrated that UA modulates the expression of executioner
   caspase (C-3, C-8 and C-9) proteins involved in the intrinsic and
   extrinsic pathways of apoptosis ([116]27). UA-induced apoptosis can be
   mediated by an increase in activated extracellular signal regulated
   kinase 1/2, Janus kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
   ([117]28). UA-induced GBC-SD cell apoptosis may also be involved in the
   intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. In addition, inhibition
   of the NF-κB and Akt signaling pathways by UA has been reported in
   other cell types ([118]29,[119]30), which is consistent with the
   present study. The pro-survival Akt and NF-κB signaling pathways are
   constitutively activated in several types of cancer, and contribute to
   cancer development and progression. The anticancer effects of certain
   dietary natural compounds are mediated by targeting the Akt and NF-κB
   pathways ([120]31,[121]32). The NF-κB pathway also has the ability to
   cross-talk with Akt pathways in various cancer types. The suppression
   of Akt may contribute to inhibiting downstream targets, including NF-κB
   p-65 and the mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9
   in GBC-SD cells ([122]33). These two genes were downregulated in the
   present study ([123]Table I) and are critical to tumor invasion.
   Certain clinical studies with a small number of patients have
   demonstrated the safety and efficacy of UA in cancer therapy ([124]11).
   Future investigations are required to analyze the precise mechanisms of
   UA and to exploit its full potential for GBC chemotherapy.

   In conclusion, UA was isolated from I. excisoides. The
   antiproliferative and anti-invasive effects of UA in GBC-SD cells were
   investigated and validated. Furthermore, UA was demonstrated to induce
   apoptosis and inhibit invasion in GBC-SD cells, which may be associated
   with the suppression of NF-κB and Akt signaling pathways. The effects
   of UA in GBC-SD cells suggest that UA may be a candidate agent for the
   chemoprevention and/or treatment of GBC progression.
